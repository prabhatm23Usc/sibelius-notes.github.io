<p><em>Is Music a Universal Language?</em></p>
<p>A Distorition of the World</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the world map. We can even flip the map. What&#39;s in the center? Europe.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to categorize music: General, use or function, culture, genre and style.</p>
<p>and Musical Features: Acoustic vs Electonic. Less cultural bound.</p>
<h2 id="music-and-music"><a class="header-link" href="#music-and-music"></a>music and Music</h2>
<p>music: the music you enjoy, seek out, identify with ...</p>
<p>Music: the entire phenomenon of human intentional sound production,  the whole humanizing complex...</p>
<p>To love music is to affirm your place in the world, to feel confident and connected within it. To love Music is to try to experience this through others, and thus get perspective on both ourselves and our fellow humans.</p>

<p>WILL BE ON TESTS!</p>
<p><strong>Dynamics</strong>: loudness or softness of sound</p>
<p><strong>Tempo</strong>: the speed at which music is (or should be) played</p>
<p><strong>Rhythm</strong>: the orgnization of sounds in time</p>
<p><strong>Timbre</strong>: The distinctive sound of an instrument or voice</p>
<p><strong>Texture</strong>: sonic layers; the way in which musical sounds are combined</p>
<p><strong>Melody</strong>: the &quot;tune&quot; in music; comprises a sequence of notes muving in a particular shape</p>
<p><strong>Musical Form</strong>: the structural orgnization of a piece of music; involves repetition, variation, and contrast</p>
<p>See listening response worksheet, which requires to be filled when listening the music. So we are required to memorize, understand and apply.</p>

<h2 id="rhythm"><a class="header-link" href="#rhythm"></a>Rhythm</h2>
<p>How can we know about time? That&#39;s how it&#39;s different from other arts.</p>
<p>defn: change in time that we measure.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Unmeasured rhythm: approximately mearsure, change the sound without beat, according the the breath
of the performer. Rely on the rest/feeling of the person. Up to musician to feel that piece. Not too surprisingly,
if we listen to them several times, we might feel it is <em>measured</em> since our body have the tendency to
feel the beat of it and measure it.</li>
<li>Measured rhythm: we can measure changing sounds more precisely when we <strong>entrain</strong> them. In entrainment we
synchronize with puslations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instrument-classification"><a class="header-link" href="#instrument-classification"></a>Instrument Classification</h2>
<p>if we classify them based on the <em>primary sound-producing medium</em>:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Chordophone: like guitar. Sound produced by bowing or plucking. Involving chords, strings.</li>
<li>Aerophone: like flute, harmonica. Sounds produced by blowing.</li>
<li>Membranophone: like drum. Sound produced by striking a stretched material over a hollow object.</li>
<li>Idiophone: Sound produced by striking, shaking, waving a solid object. An idiophone is any musical instrument that creates sound primarily by the instrument as a whole vibrating—without the use of strings or membranes.</li>
<li>Electrophone: sound involving electricity.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start from Bali in essence.</p>
<h2 id="aural-analysis---balinese-gamelan"><a class="header-link" href="#aural-analysis---balinese-gamelan"></a>Aural Analysis - Balinese Gamelan</h2>
<p>Idiophone, Membranophone, Aerophone. Makes the sound more dense, thick textures.</p>
<p>shimmering effect. The entire gamelan is tuned to the same beating. If not, then they need to be tuned.</p>

<h3 id="key-features"><a class="header-link" href="#key-features"></a>Key Features</h3>
<ol class="list">
<li>Gong cycle/pattern: use gong to mark the beginning and important points. Bring the music together.</li>
<li>Stratification: layering of instrumental parts in increasing density. Usually in ratio, 2:1, 4:1.</li>
<li>Interlocking: Rhythmically complementary parts played by pairs of musicians that combine to form a single pattern.
One melody line shared by two people.<ul class="list">
<li>like one in upbeat, one in downbeat (onbeat).</li>
<li>sometimes it&#39;s hard for one person to play due to its complex patterns.</li>

<p>Review: Instrument Classification</p>
<p>Leon Theremin: invented Theremin in 1920</p>
<p>The dancing cockatoo is demonstrating an example of measured rhythm since the music
is measured and it is trying to keep the beat... This has some relation with neuroscience...</p>
<p>We ended talking about stratification: idea of layering.</p>
<h2 id="interlocking---kotekan-(continued)"><a class="header-link" href="#interlocking---kotekan-(continued)"></a>Interlocking - Kotekan (continued)</h2>
<p><strong>Gangsa</strong>: polos, sangsih: basic, main one, the key (onbeat); the one that follows (upbeat).
(note here the beat pattern here is not always the case.)</p>
<p><strong>Reyong</strong>: plays on upbeat, downbeat.</p>
<p>The texture is polyphony or herophony (different ways, but we don&#39;t need to go into details, lots of debate on this).</p>
<h2 id="concept---how-people-think-about-music"><a class="header-link" href="#concept---how-people-think-about-music"></a>Concept - how people think about music</h2>
<p><strong>Uses</strong> are practical and experimental: to put a baby to sleep, to teach children the alphabet and ... slowly engrained in
our bodies. Use the music for particular reason.</p>
<p>Red Ant Medicineway Ceremony: use music for healing.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a time and a place for each use... For most uses music seems to be a force for good but it has a darker side, too.
(to torture (one course here PAC, music and torture, in wars.))</p>
<h2 id="merriam's-ten-functions-of-music"><a class="header-link" href="#merriam's-ten-functions-of-music"></a>Merriam&#39;s ten functions of music</h2>
<p>Memorize them ..</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>Emotional Expression (can convey feelings or ideas - for example in a horror movie the music will follow certain characteristics to intensify the &quot;fear&quot;)</li>
<li>Communication (music has specific rules like language that follow things like syntax. in our theory class when constructing phrases we referred to them as questions and answers)</li>
<li>Symbolic Representation</li>
<li>Enforcing Conformity to Social Norms</li>
<li>Validation of Social Institutions and Religious Rituals (many cultures of institutions have a song that embodies part of their individaul culture -fight song)</li>
<li>Contributes to the continuity and stability of culture</li>
<li>contribution to the integration of society</li>
<li>aesthetic enjoyment</li>
<li>entertainment</li>
<li>physical response (listening to fast-paced, upbeat music helps runners to run at a quicker pace)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Src: <a href="https://quizlet.com/8622409/merriams-10-functions-of-music-flash-cards/">quizlet</a> the order is slightly different from the one in the lecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To consider the use and what is trying to fulfil. Functions are symbolic by nature.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Indonesia is the largest Islamic nation in the world, both geographically and in terms of population</li>
<li>Bali is the only province in which Hinduism is  the major region (85% - 90%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some regions are not tight with rituals.</p>
<p>Balinese Hindu cosmology conceives of the universe as having three worlds:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Upper World: gods and ancestors</li>
<li>Middle World: humans and earthly creature</li>
<li>Lower World: malevolent spirits</li>
</ul>
<p>Calendar is also fancy. each month 35 days, different cycles. Sometimes, certain days are aligned
with these type of worlds above. Complex tradition. The music is also categorized in this way.</p>
<h2 id="typical-village-temple"><a class="header-link" href="#typical-village-temple"></a>Typical Village Temple</h2>
<p>Every village has a temple. Each temple has an anniversary date which needs celebrating, honoring. Also, human activities can take place here.</p>
<p>Kaja - north. Kelod - south.</p>
<p>Foot of sacred mountain has a big tempo.</p>
<p>Also, family temple. A piece of land, outer gate. E</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Constructing a taring (a make-shift shelter)</li>
<li>making satay sticks under the taring</li>
<li>women making offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>People do these things in groups, typically not alone.</p>
<p><strong>suka duka</strong>: happy together, sad together</p>
<p><strong>gotong royong</strong>: the pratice of mutual help</p>
<p>Last month is the most intensive, lots of work. Family temple anniversary. When you have a group of people coming to help,
you provide food and materials (like bamboos).</p>
<p><em>Overlapping sonorities at Temple Anniversary</em>: short video. Quite interesting for tourists.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-music"><a class="header-link" href="#use-of-music"></a>Use of Music</h3>
<p>During a Balinese Hindu Ceremony</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>to generate energy and strength for activities</li>
<li>to set and adjust the mood and energy flow</li>
<li>to contribute to the overall sense of rame</li>
<li>to signify the progression of events -&gt; specific music heard at each stage</li>
<li>as an offering to the gods and spirits (i.e., music mediates between the three worlds)</li>

<p><em>Ndraje Balendro, Initiation Song</em>. Horn Ensemble</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Antelope horn and tree-trunk orchestra of the Banda-Linda people</li>
<li>Central African Republic</li>
<li>Recorded by ethnomusicologist Simha Arom, ca. 1970</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we say about it?
<strong>multiple parts</strong></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>polyphonic</li>
<li>polyrhymic</li>
</ul>
<p>sounds irregular. In fact, it&#39;s very systematic. Every person knows what they need to play.</p>
<p>Overall, they are improvised. They learn from childhood. They are learning stock patterns in their childhood but they are not memorizing it. Deeply engrained, learn from this gradual process. Sth not declared, but pick these things up learning from the people.</p>
<p><strong>Encultruration</strong>: is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews. (from wiki)</p>
<p><strong>Improvised</strong>: as mentioned above</p>
<p><strong>Measured</strong>: details below</p>
<p><strong>12 pulses or beats</strong>: always grouped into 3 or 4. Since you have polyrhymic, you can easily group them by 3 or 4.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-track recordings</strong>: He recorded whole thing. Then ask one person to sing his part. Now one melody line. Then ask another person sing based on previous melodic lines. By doing this, music is not chaotic. Though sounds irregular. This is actually a fascinating project.</p>
<p>This is kinda intro to everything.</p>

<p>Martial arts. Musician standing around the circle.  Participants: mostly male. There are different schools there. The uniforms (t-shirts) are identity of who they are, where they belong to. They are loyal to their masters.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> where the music comes from: people from Africa. group of people who are not treated as humans, colonizers want to get powers/lands. European powers split into different parts in world. They came to this land, they learnt land is good for agriculture. Initially, it was indigenous people. However, people die from some diseases. So they need some people from Africa. So they bring different music tradition. These Brazil colonizers are Portugueses. Runaway slaves. People come from different African culture.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Capoeira (clip from slave to the Rhythm). martial arts is used to defend themselves. The tempo increases slightly. Intensify with the dancing. The moves become more dramatic. Interactions between music and dance. There&#39;s leader who control/maintain the intensity of the music.</p>
<p>What do they do before going to the circle? They bow. Formality before combat. You recognized each other. Also, there are different phases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From AlakskaDispatch.com. They are Inuit throat singner and drum dancer. Competition between girls while men in hunting. Half second off each other. Comes from voices, throats, breathing. Part of culture they from, very unique. Oral tradition, cannot learn from written down notes.</p>

<li>The traditional style of katajja is based on rules. TRUE. (should be in the previous notes... I&#39;ll add them later.) So this is similar to staring contest: both should stare each other&#39;s eye for a long time, the person who blink first fails. The rules here is one starts first, and the other one comes later, holding one note. One who gets his breath broken fails.</li>

<p>Extra Src Reading: <a href="http://worldhitz4u.blogspot.com/2014/01/inuit-folk-music-traditions-in-greenland.html">Inuit Folk Music Traditions in Greenland</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several Inuit traditional games revolve around song as well, including hide-and-seek, string game, juggling and rhymes and riddles. The katajjaq tradition is also popular; this is a vocal competition between two women, standing facing each other. They sing song, using throat-singing and reproducing animal cries or other sounds. Katajja is a game, but is often banned because both women begin laughing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the drum dance and game song, Greenlandic Inuit have a tradition of piseq (piserk, personal song) songs. These are expressive, superstitious, spiritual or narrative and may be composed for drum dances. Piseq and other vocal traditions aside from songs games include a series of patterns and tones, which vary depending on the social setting of the performance. For instance, a soft vocal tone is used both for character demonstration in a narrative song and for personal songs in private settings. Many songs use only a few real words, scattered among series vocals, or non-lexical syllables like ai-ya-yainga. Inuit songs are strophic and mostly use six distinct pitches; written and melodic themes are common. A song’s word length and prominence determines the rhythm, giving the songs a recitative-like pattern.</p>

<p>What are soem cross-cultural features of lullabies? (recall from last class)</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>slow, calming, repetitive</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <em>&quot;Arao Ariraro&quot;</em> south Indian lullaby</p>
<p>We can think of how melody descend. How do we use lullabies? form of communication, sth specific: stop crying... It might have specific meaning to words. Does the lyrics mean anything? No, they are vocables. Often, physical motion is associated to that.</p>
<p>From slides:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>higher range than other songs</li>
<li>greater internal repetition</li>
<li>incorporate vocables within texts</li>
<li>slow tempo</li>
<li>sung in combination with rocking motion</li>
<li>lullabies and rocking provide a good example of musical entrainment (i.e., alignment of body motion during musical experience)</li>
<li>Entrainment can help regularize motion and modify a person&#39;s physical state</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has sth to contribute to the music or dance. Social binding.</p>
