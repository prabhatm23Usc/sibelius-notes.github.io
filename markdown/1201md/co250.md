# Lecture 1
Starting example.

*What is opt?*

Abstracting optimization problems have this form: we are given \\(A\subseteq \mathbb R^n\\) and a function \\(f:A\to\mathbb R\\). The goal is to find \\(x\in A\\) that minimizes/maximizes \\(f(x)\\).

*What are linear programs?*

Linear programs (LPs) is a class of optimization problems that can be efficiently solved using variables \\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\\), a function is **affine** if it has the form \\(a_1x_1+\ldots+a_nx_n+b\\) for some constants \\(a_1,\ldots,a_b,b\\). It is **linear** if in addition, \\(b=0\\). In vector form, if \\(x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^T\\) and \\(a=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)^T\\), then \\(a^Tx+b\\) is affine, and \\(a^Tx\\) is linear.

A linear program has objective function \\(\max f(x)\\) or \\(\min f(x)\\) where \\(f(x)\\) is affine, and constraints of the form \\(g(x)\le b\\), or \\(g(x)\ge b\\) for some linear \\(g\\), constraint \\(b\\).

# Lecture 2
LP formulations and IP formulations.

IP is a linear program except we restrict variables to take on only integer values.

# Lecture 3
IP formulations.

optimization on graphs.

A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) consists of a set of objects \\(V\\) called vertices and a collection of unordered paris of vertices \\(E\\) called edges.

## maximum weight matching problem

\\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\max & \begin{array}{l}w^T x\end{array}\\\\
\text{s.t.} & \begin{array}{lll}
Ax\le 1\\\\
x_e\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} \quad \forall e\in E
\end{array}
\end{array}
\\]
The constraints  force \\(x_e\le 1\\) so we can reduce this to \\(x_e\ge 0,x_e\in\mathbb Z\\) for all \\(e\in E\\).


## shortest path problem

**Variables**:  Define \\(x_e\\) for each \\(e\in E\\) to represent \\(x_e=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } e \text{ is in the path} \\\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\\)

\\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\min & \begin{array}{l}w^Tx\end{array}\\\\
\text{s.t.} & \begin{array}{lll}
x_e\in \\\\{0,1\\\\}\quad \forall e\in E
\end{array}
\end{array}    
\\]



Given \\(W\subseteq V\\), the **cut induced by** \\(W\\) is the set of all edges with exactly one endpoint in \\(W\\). Notation: \\(\delta(W)\\).
\\(\delta(W) = \\\\{uv\in E: u\in W, v\not\in W\\\\}\\). This \\(\delta(W)\\) is an \\(s,t\\)-cut
 if \\(s\in W\\) and \\(t\not\in W\\).

**Key observation**: Given an \\(s,t\\)-cut \\(\delta(W)\\), any \\(s,t\\)-path must use at least one edge in \\(\delta(W)\\).

**One possible constraint**: For each \\(s,t\\)-cut, at least one edge must be in the path.
\\[
    \sum_{e\in\delta(W)}x_e\ge 1 \qquad \forall s,t\text{-cuts }\delta(W)
\\]

# Lecture 5
**Problem:** A feasible solution may not be a \\(s,t\\)-path. For example, \\(x_e=1, \quad \forall e\in E\\).

**Resolution**:
1. If a set of edges intersets every s,t-cut, then this set of edges must contain an s,t-path. (i.e., it has an s,t-path plus possibly other edges).
2. We assumed \\(w_e>0\\) for all \\(e\in E\\). If we have edges that are not part of an s,t-path, we can remove them and get a better solution (lower obj value).

Therefore, an optimal solution must correspond to an s,t-path.

By the same argument, we don't need \\(x_e\le 1\\). Any higher values of \\(x_e\\) would not be optimal.

    x_e\ge 0,\quad x_e\in \mathbb Z&\forall e\in E\end{array}
