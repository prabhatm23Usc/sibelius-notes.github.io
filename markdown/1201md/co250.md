# Lecture 1
Starting example.

*What is opt?*

Abstracting optimization problems have this form: we are given \\(A\subseteq \mathbb R^n\\) and a function \\(f:A\to\mathbb R\\). The goal is to find \\(x\in A\\) that minimizes/maximizes \\(f(x)\\).

*What are linear programs?*

Linear programs (LPs) is a class of optimization problems that can be efficiently solved using variables \\(x_1,\ldots,x_n\\), a function is **affine** if it has the form \\(a_1x_1+\ldots+a_nx_n+b\\) for some constants \\(a_1,\ldots,a_b,b\\). It is **linear** if in addition, \\(b=0\\). In vector form, if \\(x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^T\\) and \\(a=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)^T\\), then \\(a^Tx+b\\) is affine, and \\(a^Tx\\) is linear.

A linear program has objective function \\(\max f(x)\\) or \\(\min f(x)\\) where \\(f(x)\\) is affine, and constraints of the form \\(g(x)\le b\\), or \\(g(x)\ge b\\) for some linear \\(g\\), constraint \\(b\\).

# Lecture 2
LP formulations and IP formulations.

IP is a linear program except we restrict variables to take on only integer values.

# Lecture 3
IP formulations.

optimization on graphs.

A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) consists of a set of objects \\(V\\) called vertices and a collection of unordered paris of vertices \\(E\\) called edges.

\begin{matrix*}[l]
\max & \begin{array}{l}w^T x\end{array}\\\\
\text{s.t.} & \begin{array}{lll}
Ax\le 1\\\\
x_e\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} \quad \forall e\in E
\end{array}
\end{matrix*}
\\]
The constraints  force \\(x_e\le 1\\) so we can reduce this to \\(x_e\ge 0,x_e\in\mathbb Z\\) for all \\(e\in E\\).
