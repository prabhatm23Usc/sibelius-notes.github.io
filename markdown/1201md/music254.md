    * 1734
    * 1768: disonances create tension
    * 19C
    * Late 19C
    * 1950s: used to describe era.
* Contradictions:
    * Music: break with immediate past
    * Absolute monarch patrons of music
    * 17C-early 18C: bloody wars
* 1st half 17C
* some well-known composers born late

## Difference between Renaissance & Baroque
Micheelangelo, David: static
Bernini, David: motion, emotion

**Baroque Sculpture**: drama, virtuosity, emotion. See examples in textbook.

**Baroque Music**: drama, virtuosity, emotion!
* Some examples

# Music of the early Baroque: Characteristics of a New Era

## 3 streams in Baroque & 3 streams in Classical eras
a) Vocal music

b) rise of the violin family: foundation of orchstra

c) keyboard music

## General Characteristics of Baroque Music
1. Texture
    - treble-bass polarity: two different threads
    - basso continuo: emphasize bass part, foundation of music.
        - only bass line.
        - improvised. They would understand and then improvise.
        - figured bass notation. Up to performer to fill it up.
        - Later Baroque often 2 instruments:
            - bass line + chords: keyboard or plucked instrument  like organ, lute, theorbo (long extension to have bass sound.)
            - bass line: reinforced by bassoon...
    - combining voices and intruments: colors. New thing.
        - Different instrument has different tuning system. String instruments can be adjusted easily, but not the case with keyboard.
        - independent tuning systems:
            - mean-tone for keyboard.
        - equal temperament (compromise). Take the octave and divide it by 12 equal semitones.
2. Harmony

They are not thinking major minor, instead, modal music previously. Bass oriented and build it up. More types of dissonances (clashes) were permitted.

3. Rhythm
    - bar lines and time signatures.
    - contrast and pairing: improvised rhythm in prelude, but strict in fugue.

4. Emotion
    - Affections: states of mind, such as sadness, joy.
    - Relatively stable. Cause body fluids in bounds.
    - arouse affections
    - embellishment: emotional impact. Not written in.


### Dramatic Shift in Musical Practice
Claudio Monteverdi
- 5th book of Madrigals
- 5-voices madrigal: polyphonic setting of a 16C Italian poem
- Breaking rules of dissonances for dramatic effect
- word painting
    - using musical gestures
        - cruda (cruel)
        - jeering laughter

#### Bitter Debate: Artusi vs Monteverdi
Monteverdi: build on the previous foundation

First Practice: Monteverdi's term.
- Zarlino & Artusi
- rules: dissonances. Carefully prepared and resolved.
- Palestrina: benchmark

Second Practice: more modern. Cruda (cruel)

# The Birth of Opera
## Camerata
Caccini, singer in the group

1570s & 80s.
- discussed literature, science & arts
- Members: V. Galilei (father of Gallieo Galilei)...
- Greek tragedy as model. really move people
- speculated on role of music in ancient theatre
- Criticized current vocal polyphony. can't understand the word. Somewhere between song and speech.
- Developed Monody: accompanied solo singing.
    - texture? solo song + 1 instrument. bass continuo

## Caccini I'll see my sun
style is very different, example of monody. Prototype of recitative(宣叙调): made opera possible.

repetition not happened in recitatives. but you have time to pause in opera.

## Opera & its antecendents
opera = italian for work = drama with music

## antecendents
1. pastroal drama (1471, Florence: on Orfeo)
2. madrigals: emotion, dramatizing poetry
3. Intermedio: interesting invention: musical interlude on a pastroal, allegorical or myyhological subjects before, after between acts of play

Most famous one: Florence, 1589 for a wedding of Grand Duke...

Orpheus: musician. rock beat. not a happy guy.

## Recitative
Peri's recitative style (see textbook source reading)

halfway between singing and speaking (speech). no repetition, through composed. Words are clear, and vocal line are written to reflect the words.

stressed syllables: consonant with bass.

Caccini: lots of repetition of text, ornamations. but this is different. has own opera. Published before Peri's (rival...)

aria or recitative, are mostly accompanied by bass continuo.

## 2 exerpts: 2 styles of monody used in Peri's opera, L'Euridice
a) Tirsi's song "Nel pur ardor"
- aira = "air" or song
- more strict rhythm because of dance music, dance rhythm
- very charming...
- Introduced by Sinfonia.
- pastroal style
    - compoound lilting meter (6/4)
    - drone
    - 2 recorders with lilting
    - Parallel 3rds motion

b) Dafne (new style)
* employs bass continuo
* mirrors speech
* syllabic setting: one note per syllable

Lots of repeated notes. In the score, only bass line and voice. Lots of words are in B-flat, which is similar to
our speech, monotone. Candence, end of phrase. Sheppard is coming after her.

- Dafne
- Orfeo's reaction: breathless then grief (unprepared dissonances, hold over notes, unexpected harmonic progressions)

this expressive recitative: ability to melt the words, emotitions.

## Monteverdi - L'Orfeo
Monteverdi did sth different. 40 when coming to opera. Great gig, works for Italian family (rich powerful).
Grew up in very difficult time when getting the gig.

- first opera
- libretto: Allssandro Striggio
- first performance: Mantua
- private entertainment: room in apartments of Gonzaga family
- modelled on Peri but musically & dramatically more effective
    - expanded Rinuccini's 5 scences to prologue + 5 acts. Grab the same story.
    - recitative: more varied than Peri's. More variations.
    - Orchestra: larger, more variety, specific instrument.
- story based on Orpheus legend.
- Characters:
    - allegorical
    - pastroal
    - underworld
    - Euridice, Orfeo, Sylvia (messenger)
    - Chorus: empathizes the character. very important function
    - Orchestra

### Act II excerpt
a) Orfeo's aria

Music:
- regular dance rhythm
- strophic
- only voice + bass continuo

He is just so happy. Strong rhythm. Joy.

- ritornello: "refrain"
    - 5 parts

b) short shepherd's song

c) Messenger's recitative
- Dialogues: horrorable expression on her face. Back and forth. When messenger arrives... Another shepherd wants to interject, bring to his understanding.
    - basso continuo: switch to wooden pipe organ & theorbo
- Messenger narrates death of Euridice.
    - varied style: straight narration -> highly emotive.
    - Music: more chromatic, jarring.

d) Orfeo's lament (哀叹)
- barely speak
- basso continuo: wooden pipe organ & theorbo, again... specify this specific dialogue.
- chromatic, dissonant, jarring.
- word painting: "goodbye earth.."
    - sudden plunge

e) Chorus: Greek chorus
* Part I: share grief. bassline takes the initial melody, share the grief.
* Part II: moral of drama.

# Early Baroque Vocal Music for Church and Chamber: Strozzi, Carissimi, Schutz
Babara Strozzi (1619-1677): interesting character. early 17C. Probably natural daughter of Giulio Strozzi. Only women to the groups (literature arts science and so on). Sing beautifully. Amazing women. One of most prolific composers of vocal chamber music.

Venice
## Strozzi

Her Cantata (Lagrime mie)
- Cantata: piece to be sung (Italian)
- secular, not meant for church
- one voice with basso continuo
- private. For her all amazing singing, no opera or public.
- poetry: free form. male perspective.
- several secions of recitative, arioso (somewhere between aira and recitative), aria ~ narrative & lyrical poetry
- softened recitative style

### Form:
- mm1-22: lament: recitative, long melismas (“tears”, “pain”, “heart”)
- mm23-48: narration about Lidia:
    - arioso: style of singing that approaches the lyricism of aria but is freer in form
- mm49-62: descending bass line, triple meter, long melisma (“weep”)
- mm63-70: opening lament returns
- mm71-87: strophic aria (4X 8-syllable lines)
- mm 88-96: recitative
- mm97-end: triple meter, descending bass line (repeated)
- [+ mm 1-22: repeats opening lament]

every single section, she's applying techniques from early opera.

- word-painting/text depiction: opening lament (conventional devices: opening recitative: weeping, sobbing)
    - long melisma on “La-grime”
    - minor mode: E minor
    - dissonances: D♯ F♯ over E
    - augmented intervals: D♯-C♮: notes of harmonic minor scale
    - descending line on 'La': falling tears. In Baroque, it usually means death, sad.


Now go to Rome.

## Carissimi
Giacomo Carissimi (1605-1674): 1629: Master of the chapel & teacher at Jesuit college in Rome
- described as "musical orator"; patron; musical works protected by decree of Popes
- Archives destroyed in 1773 crackdown on Jesuits & Napoleon's raids
- Oratorios written for the Archoconfraternita del SS Concifrisso

not performed in church.

### Oratorio
- ORATORIO: “oratorio” (Italian) = prayer hall (named for where performed & groups met)
- religious dramatic music for outside church: incl. narrative, dialogue & commentary
- Only musical performances allowed during Lent (religious event)
- text: Latin or Italian
- operatic: recitatives, arias, instrumental preludes & ritornellos.

but how is it different from opera?
- sacred subject matter
- not staged: nattared (sung): describe action
- greater role to chorus

Particular work
### NAWM 80: Carissimi, Historia di Jephte (Story of Jephte, ca. 1648)
- Latin: paraphrased biblically based story (from Judges)

Promise: if wins the war, first person come sacrifices, but it's his daughter singing happily.

a) solo recitative [+ echo]: daughter (filia), “Plorate colles” (Weep, Hills), from final scene
- Basso continuo: theorbo
- Echo: 2 singers (2 friends) biting harmonies
- lament: long recitative + arioso passages
- repeated words/phrases
- flatten melodic pitches: pathos
- harmony: expressive dissonances

b) Chorus: “Plorate filii Israel” (Weep, Sons of Israe)
- 6-voice chorus
- Repeats last 4 lines of daughter's lament
- Opening: bass line descends twice through 4ths
    - gesture of lament
- downward movement all voices, lots of tension.
- dissonances: suspensions: pile up at end of section

new invention of 17th century. Operatic someways, not staged, but ok for that time.

## Heinrich Schütz
Wealthy. German composers, very influenced. Influenced by two different composers, Gabrieli and Monteverdi (in 1628).
- Studied with G. Gabrieli in Venice, 1609-1612.
- (1585-1672): 1615-72: master of chapel of Elector of Saxony, Dresden
- 1618-48: 30 Years War

### NAWM81: Saul, was verfolgst du mich? (ca. 1650) (Saul, why do you persecute me?)
- Post-war collection of Symphoniae sacreae
    - used full force of Dresden chapel
- **Sacred Concerto** = grand concerto in Gabrieli's Venetian style:
    - large-scale work, mixing voices & instruments
    - style: merges Gabrieli’s polychoral style with Monteverdi’s expressiveness
        - e.g. Gabrieli *In Ecclesiis*: 4 solos, 4-part chorus, 6 part instrumental ensemble, organs. Many styles: modern aira, late 16C polyphony.
- based on Paul (Saul)'s conversation
- Schutz's score:
    - 2 violins
    - 6 solo voices (SSATBB)
    - 2 X 4-voice choirs (doubled by instruments)
    - bass continuo (organ + cello/theorbo for recitative sections)

* form:
    - sectional: exploits forces & dramatizes text:
    - mm1-16: "Saul, Why do you persecute me?”
        - 4 pairs of solos rise from depths
        - D minor - A minor - F major - D major
        - “persecute” (“verfolgst”): intense dissonance. Not bright.
    - mm 17-23: chorus & solos: grand concerto style
        - echoes: dynamics (f - mp - pp). Want to sound like echo via dynamics.
        - D major
    - mm21-23: Short 6/8 meter & G major/minor: distortion of echoes?
    - m.24: recitative style:
        - solo voice + basso continuo (“it will be difficult for you”)
        - Passed from Tenor – Alto
        - "Kick": ornamental turn
    - m.34: choral refrain “Saul...”
    - m. 39: recitative material in imitation
        - “kick”: now a long melisma. lots of notes.
    - m.60: recitative & polychoral styles combined
        - grows in intensity and ends in pianissimo echo
* Musical figures:
    - In Baroque, melodic pattern or contrapuntal effect conventionally employed to convey the meaning of a text
    - Codified by Schutz's text
    - break old rules, but give a name what gestures mean. 2 examples. Not accidentals.
        - harsh cadential notes
        - harsh leap

# Baroque Instrumental Music I: the Violin Family – Marini, Corelli, Vivaldi
## 2 main string families in Baroque:
Viol family
- Viola da gambda (=viola of the leg)
    - invented in Spain, late 15C
    - 6 strings
    - frets, like guitar
    - bowed underhand, creates different sound
    - different size
    - violone (big viol) by 1600 - persisted as continuo instrument
    - used in court & chamber music

Violin Family
- Viola "da braccio" (=arm): violin & viola
    * violin, viola, violoncello
    * emerged independent of viols
    * 4 strings (tuned in 5th) - ca. 1550
    * no frets
    * overhand bow
    * early use for dancing

Note the difference between Baroque Violin and modern Violin.

missed due to the <s>**shit**</s> interview... To be filled later

## Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741)
- son of St Mark's violinist (Venice)
- conductor, composer, priest, teacher: Ospedale della Pieta, Venice (1703-40)
- 1737: censured for behaviour; died pauper
- He wrote a lot of instrumental music, but he also write 49 operas, and direct by himself.

## Concerto
= composition in which one or more solo instruments (or instrumental group) contrast with an orchestral ensemble
- concerto grosso: contrast between group of soloist (concertino) (as opposed to one)  & whole orchestra
- solo concerto: contrast between a single soloist & whole orchestra

### Example: Concerto for Violin in A Minor, Op.3, no.6
**Solo Concerto**:
- 3 movements: fast - slow - fast
- fast movements: Ritornello Form
    - standard form for fast movements in concertos
    - featuring a ritornello (refrain) for full orchestra
    - alternates with episodes characterized by virtuosic material played by one or more soloist

**Ritornello** = refrains
- is a recurring passage in Baroque music for orchestra or chorus. (from wiki)

**Episodes** = passages featuring soloist between ritornellos

Middle movement is different.
1. Allegro: A minor
2. Largo cantabile: D minor
3. Presto: A minor

# Baroque Instrumental Music: Keyboard Music: Instruments, Composers, Forms & Styles
## Keyboard Instruments
- Harpsichord: keyboard instruement popular 15C - 18C; strings plucked by quill. Doesn't have wide range but you can combine two to create different sounds.
- Clavichord:
    - popular 15C - 18C
    - brass tangent strikes string
    - stays in contact as long as key depressed
    - loudness controlled by player
    - unlike piano or harpsichord, it has tangent. you can control the sound quality of the string.
    - quite small in 17th C. Not for a big group of people, maybe at home.
    - more like a lute, guitar, since plucke the string. Mechanically by a keyboard.

**Girolamo Frescobaldi**: popular, well-known during his life time. But he is also organist. Teach Harpsichord. He also wrote some Toccata.

## Italian Keyboard Toccata
**Toccata**: Italian "touched"
- for keyboard or lute. Sounds like improvised
- may contain imitative sections (repeating melodic material in another part or parts)
- style: improvisatory, exploratory, virtuosic, free-sounding
    - player explores a range of harmonies & figurations
    - often played as preludes to other pieces
    - clearly defined the mode/key of following piece.

*1615: Toccatas and Partitas Intabulated for Harpsichord, Book I*
* 1st conceived exclusively for keyboard
* Idiomatically suited to harpsichord
    * fits easily under 2 hands
    * avoided long sustained sounds

### Frescobaldi, *Toccata No.3*
* harpsichord
* maintains forward momentum: from constant motion, evaded candences; restless character
* Typical: series of brief phrases or sections
    - each closed with a cadence, distinct figuration
* Style shifts frequently
    * Opening: like recitative
    * m.5: like Arioso: chains of suspensions over walking bass
    * mm.8-11: imitative passage
    * rest of the piece: shifts every 2 or 3 bars
    * Improvised sound
    * Also improvised ornaments

## French Baroque Suite
**Elisabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre** (1665-1729)
- French
- harpsichordist & composer
- 1687: 1st publication – works for harpsichord
- chlid prodigy: age 5 sang & performed at court of Louis XIV
- Paris: gave lessons & concerts
- very accomplished women

### Suite No. 3 in A Minor, *Pièces de clavecin* [Pieces for Harpsichord], Book I (ca 1687)
* Suite
    - collection of stylized dances
    - from trend of pairing dance types
    - contrasting tempos & character
    - NOT danced: psychological states
* Form: most dances in binary ||: A :||: B :||

prelude:
- improvisatory
- slurs...: sustained notes, phrase groupings
- no bar lines, no time signature
- explores key

allemande: "German"
- moderate 4/4 meter; begins with upbeat
- 8th & 16th note
- picardy third at the end  

courante:
- Moderate 3 or compound meter; begins with upbeat
- Hemiola: shifts between 3/2 & 6/4

sarabande
- slow
- dignified
- triple meter, emphasis on 2nd beat

gigue (jig)
- (England/Ireland)
- fast, compound meter 6/4
- bach has been doing this

### Ornamentation (argrements)
* Harpsichord imitating lute (style luthe): Borrowed figuration & practice
* Pratical reasions for ornaments on harpsichord?
    - sound only has short period of time. So to compensate for decaying sound of plucked strings
    - emphasizes notes.
* Artistic reasons?
    - Aesthetic
    - taste
    - Performer can add ornaments (acc. to taste)
* notes inegales: "uneven notes": 17C French convention of performing passages of short notes of even duration by alternating longer and shorter notes to create a lilting rhythm

Some common French ornaments: Pince. Tremblement. Double. Port de voix.

## GERMANY: ORGAN PRELUDE
**Organ**
instrument consisting of a number of pipes that sound tones when supplied with pressurized air & a keyboard that operates a mechanism controlling the flow of air to the pipes
- Ranks of pipes engaged by stops; one pitch/pipe
- One or more manuals & pedal board
- Pre-electricity: one person operated bellows.
- continuously supply of wind, so long sustained notes possible

You can hold a note for years...

1650-1750: Golden age of Lutheran German organ music

### Dietrich Buxtehude
- 1668-1707: Organist, St Mary’s Church in Lübeck (N. Germany)
- didn't publish his works; found after his death
- Abendmusiken (free evening concerts during Advent)
    - 1705-6: JS Bach visited, walked 378 kms
- Liturgical Function: Sunday services:
    - started with large Prelude for organ, as well as preludes for other portions of the service
    - BuxWV141: probably prelude to service; challenge for organ students

#### NAWM 97: Praeludium in E major, BuxWV 141
- late 17th century
- organ (2 manuals + pedal)
- Praeludium (Latin = Prelude)
    - = Toccata: free & imitative/fugal sections alternate
    - = Series of short sections in free style alternating with longer ones in imitative counterpoint
- virtuosic: keyboards & pedals
- suggest improvisation
- imitative/fugal sections have related themes
- 4 imitative/fugal sections preceded by free sections
- Free Fugue Free Fugal/Figurative Fugal Trans Fugue Coda

actual music is half step higher than the score

# J.S. Bach I: Instrumental Music
**J S Bach**: church gigues. didn't write opera...

## Review of Fugue
* **FUGUE**: a musical genre based on the systematic imitation of a theme
* **IMITATION**: texture of independent musical lines (as opposed to homophonic)
* **VOICES**: independent musical lines representing different ranges
    * usually no more than 4 (SATB)
    * ranges on a keyboard or in an orchestra
* **EXPOSITION**: opening section of a fugue where each voice states the entire theme *once*
    * **SUBJECT**: the main theme of a fugue, the musical “idea”
    * **ANSWER**: a statement of the subject in the exposition starting on a different note
        * usually the 2nd and 4th statement of the subject
    * **COUNTERSUBJECT**: a theme that is played/sung at the same time as the subject
        * usually stated by a voice that has already stated the subject
    * The exposition ends once all the voices have stated the subject once only

*WHAT FOLLOWS THE EXPOSITION?*
* Alternation of
    * **EPISODES**: sections without statements of the subject
    * **STATEMENTS OF THE SUBJECT**: one or two voices state the subject
    * **MODULATIONS**: go through many different keys before returning to the tonic

## NAWM 100: Bach, Prelude & Fugue in A Minor
- for organ
- ca. 1715: Weimar
Main points:
1. pair of pieces
    * free & fugal: no more alternating sections
2. idomatic writing borrowed from another genre/instruement
    - influence of Italian concerto composers: like Vivaldi
    - Prelude: violinsitic figuration
    - fugue subject: like ritornello form of concertos
        - episodes like solo sections; return of subject like ritornellos
