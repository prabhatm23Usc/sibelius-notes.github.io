# Music of the early Baroque: Characteristics of a New Era

## 3 streams in Baroque & 3 streams in Classical eras
a) Vocal music

b) rise of the violin family: foundation of orchstra

c) keyboard music

## General Characteristics of Baroque Music
1. Texture
    - treble-bass polarity: two different threads
    - basso continuo: emphasize bass part, foundation of music.
        - only bass line.
        - improvised. They would understand and then improvise.
        - figured bass notation. Up to performer to fill it up.
        - Later Baroque often 2 instruments:
            - bass line + chords: keyboard or plucked instrument  like organ, lute, theorbo (long extension to have bass sound.)
            - bass line: reinforced by bassoon...
    - combining voices and intruments: colors. New thing.
        - Different instrument has different tuning system. String instruments can be adjusted easily, but not the case with keyboard.
        - independent tuning systems:
            - mean-tone for keyboard.
        - equal temperament (compromise). Take the octave and divide it by 12 equal semitones.
2. Harmony

They are not thinking major minor, instead, modal music previously. Bass oriented and build it up. More types of dissonances (clashes) were permitted.

3. Rhythm
    - bar lines and time signatures.
    - contrast and pairing: improvised rhythm in prelude, but strict in fugue.

4. Emotion
    - Affections: states of mind, such as sadness, joy.
    - Relatively stable. Cause body fluids in bounds.
    - arouse affections
    - embellishment: emotional impact. Not written in.


### Dramatic Shift in Musical Practice
Claudio Monteverdi
- 5th book of Madrigals
- 5-voices madrigal: polyphonic setting of a 16C Italian poem
- Breaking rules of dissonances for dramatic effect
- word painting
    - using musical gestures
        - cruda (cruel)
        - jeering laughter

#### Bitter Debate: Artusi vs Monteverdi
Monteverdi: build on the previous foundation

First Practice: Monteverdi's term.
- Zarlino & Artusi
- rules: dissonances. Carefully prepared and resolved.
- Palestrina: benchmark

Second Practice: more modern. Cruda (cruel)

# The Birth of Opera
## Camerata
Caccini, singer in the group

1570s & 80s.
- discussed literature, science & arts
- Members: V. Galilei (father of Gallieo Galilei)...
- Greek tragedy as model. really move people
- speculated on role of music in ancient theatre
- Criticized current vocal polyphony. can't understand the word. Somewhere between song and speech.
- Developed Monody: accompanied solo singing.
    - texture? solo song + 1 instrument. bass continuo

## Caccini I'll see my sun
style is very different, example of monody. Prototype of recitative(宣叙调): made opera possible.

repetition not happened in recitatives. but you have time to pause in opera.

## Opera & its antecendents
opera = italian for work = drama with music

## antecendents
1. pastroal drama (1471, Florence: on Orfeo)
2. madrigals: emotion, dramatizing poetry
3. Intermedio: interesting invention: musical interlude on a pastroal, allegorical or myyhological subjects before, after between acts of play

Most famous one: Florence, 1589 for a wedding of Grand Duke...

Orpheus: musician. rock beat. not a happy guy.

## Recitative

halfway between singing and speaking (speech). no repetition, through composed. Words are clear, and vocal line are written to reflect the words.

Caccini: lots of repetition of text, ornamations. but this is different.

## 2 exerpts
more strict rhythm since dance music.
