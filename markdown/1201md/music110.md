*Is Music a Universal Language?*

A Distorition of the World

Let's look at the world map. We can even flip the map. What's in the center? Europe.

There are so many ways to categorize music: General, use or function, culture, genre and style.

and Musical Features: Acoustic vs Electonic. Less cultural bound.

## music and Music
music: the music you enjoy, seek out, identify with ...

Music: the entire phenomenon of human intentional sound production,  the whole humanizing complex...

To love music is to affirm your place in the world, to feel confident and connected within it. To love Music is to try to experience this through others, and thus get perspective on both ourselves and our fellow humans.

## A Triparitite Model for Musical Study
Venn diagram:

- Concept: how people think about music
- Behaviour and Context: tangible activities associated with a performance
- Sound: the music "itself"
    - Musical instruments
    - Musical aspects: rhythm, melody, dynamics
    - Different kinds of compositions or structures for music

### Musical Aspects
WILL BE ON TESTS!

**Dynamics**: loudness or softness of sound

**Tempo**: the speed at which music is (or should be) played

**Rhythm**: the orgnization of sounds in time

**Timbre**: The distinctive sound of an instrument or voice

**Texture**: sonic layers; the way in which musical sounds are combined

**Melody**: the "tune" in music; comprises a sequence of notes muving in a particular shape

**Musical Form**: the structural orgnization of a piece of music; involves repetition, variation, and contrast

See listening response worksheet, which requires to be filled when listening the music. So we are required to memorize, understand and apply.

# Lec 4 - Jan 16th
**HW - Listening**: twinkle twinkle little star

truncate the phrase and find the beat.

## Rhythm
How can we know about time? That's how it's different from other arts.

defn: change in time that we measure.

- Unmeasured rhythm: approximately mearsure, change the sound without beat, according the the breath
of the performer. Rely on the rest/feeling of the person. Up to musician to feel that piece. Not too surprisingly,
if we listen to them several times, we might feel it is *measured* since our body have the tendency to
feel the beat of it and measure it.
- Measured rhythm: we can measure changing sounds more precisely when we **entrain** them. In entrainment we
synchronize with puslations.

## Instrument Classification
if we classify them based on the *primary sound-producing medium*:
* Chordophone: like guitar. Sound produced by bowing or plucking. Involving chords, strings.
* Aerophone: like flute, harmonica. Sounds produced by blowing.
* Membranophone: like drum. Sound produced by striking a stretched material over a hollow object.
* Idiophone: Sound produced by striking, shaking, waving a solid object. An idiophone is any musical instrument that creates sound primarily by the instrument as a whole vibratingâ€”without the use of strings or membranes.
* Electrophone: sound involving electricity.

We start from Bali in essence.

## Aural Analysis - Balinese Gamelan
Idiophone, Membranophone, Aerophone. Makes the sound more dense, thick textures.

shimmering effect. The entire gamelan is tuned to the same beating. If not, then they need to be tuned.

Key Aesthetic: Ombak (wave)
- paired-tuning
- gong

Five-Tone Selisir Tuning
- nIng 1
- nOng 2
- nEng 3
- nUng 5
- nAng 6

Gong marks the essential structural of the piece.

### Key Features
1. Gong cycle: use gong to mark the beginning and important points
2. Stratification: layering of instrumental parts in increasing density. Usually in ratio, 2:1, 4:1.
3. Interlocking: Rhythmically complementary parts played by pairs of musicians that combine to form a single pattern.
One melody line shared by two people.
    - like one in upbeat, one in downbeat (onbeat).
    - sometimes it's hard for one person to play due to its complex patterns.

# Lec 5 - Jan 21st
Review: Instrument Classification

Leon Theremin: invented Theremin in 1920

The dancing cockatoo is demonstrating an example of measured rhythm since the music
is measured and it is trying to keep the beat... This has some relation with neuroscience...

We ended talking about stratification: idea of layering.

## Interlocking - Kotekan (continued)
**Gangsa**: polos, sangsih: basic, main one, the key (onbeat); the one that follows (upbeat).
(note here the beat pattern here is not always the case.)

**Reyong**: upbeat, downbeat.

The texture is polyphony or herophony (different ways, but we don't need to go into details, lots of debate on this).

## Concept - how people think about music
**Uses** are practical and experimental: to put a baby to sleep, to teach children the alphabet and ... slowly engrained in
our bodies. Use the music for particular reason.

Red Ant Medicineway Ceremony: use music for healing.

There's a time and a place for each use... For most uses music seems to be a force for good but it has a darker side, too.
(to torture (one course here PAC, music and torture, in wars.))

## Merriam's ten functions of music
Memorize them ..
1. Emotional Expression (can convey feelings or ideas - for example in a horror movie the music will follow certain characteristics to intensify the "fear")
2. Communication (music has specific rules like language that follow things like syntax. in our theory class when constructing phrases we referred to them as questions and answers)
3. Symbolic Representation
4. Enforcing Conformity to Social Norms
5. Validation of Social Institutions and Religious Rituals (many cultures of institutions have a song that embodies part of their individaul culture -fight song)
6. Contributes to the continuity and stability of culture
7. contribution to the integration of society
8. aesthetic enjoyment
9. entertainment
10. physical response (listening to fast-paced, upbeat music helps runners to run at a quicker pace)

> Src: [quizlet](https://quizlet.com/8622409/merriams-10-functions-of-music-flash-cards/) the order is slightly different from the one in the lecture.

To consider the use and what is trying to fulfil. Functions are symbolic by nature.

* Indonesia is the largest Islamic nation in the world, both geographically and in terms of population
* Bali is the only province in which Hinduism is  the major region (85% - 90%)

Some regions are not tight with rituals.

Balinese Hindu cosmology conceives of the universe as having three worlds:
- Upper World: gods and ancestors
- Middle World: humans and earthly creature
- Lower World: malevolent spirits

Calendar is also fancy. each month 35 days, different cycles. Sometimes, certain days are aligned
with these type of worlds above. Complex tradition. The music is also categorized in this way.

## Typical Village Temple
Every village has a temple. Each temple has an anniversary date which needs celebrating, honoring. Also, human activities can take place here.

Kaja - north. Kelod - south.

Foot of sacred mountain has a big tempo.

Also, family temple. A piece of land, outer gate. E

Some examples:
- Constructing a taring (a make-shift shelter)
- making satay sticks under the taring
- women making offerings

People do these things in groups, typically not alone.

**suka duka**: happy together, sad together

**gotong royong**: the pratice of mutual help

Last month is the most intensive, lots of work. Family temple anniversary. When you have a group of people coming to help,
you provide food and materials (like bamboos).

*Overlapping sonorities at Temple Anniversary*: short video. Quite interesting for tourists.

### Use of Music
During a Balinese Hindu Ceremony
* to generate energy and strength for activities
* to set and adjust the mood and energy flow
* to contribute to the overall sense of rame
* to signify the progression of events -> specific music heard at each stage
* as an offering to the gods and spirits (i.e., music mediates between the three worlds)

## Art for Art's Sake
*President opens a Bali arts festival*

## Gong Kebyar Competition
Each group represents a particular region. Clap for sth good, boo (or throw tomatoes) for sth bad. You need to have strong performance. They practice about 3-4 months...

The spirit of community and interction are highly valued in Bali. Ritual and musical activities are symbols of communal interdependence.
