*Is Music a Universal Language?*

A Distorition of the World

Let's look at the world map. We can even flip the map. What's in the center? Europe.

There are so many ways to categorize music: General, use or function, culture, genre and style.

and Musical Features: Acoustic vs Electonic. Less cultural bound.

## music and Music
music: the music you enjoy, seek out, identify with ...

Music: the entire phenomenon of human intentional sound production,  the whole humanizing complex...

To love music is to affirm your place in the world, to feel confident and connected within it. To love Music is to try to experience this through others, and thus get perspective on both ourselves and our fellow humans.

## A Triparitite Model for Musical Study
Venn diagram:

- Concept: how people think about music
- Behaviour and Context: tangible activities associated with a performance
- Sound: the music "itself"
    - Musical instruments
    - Musical aspects: rhythm, melody, dynamics
    - Different kinds of compositions or structures for music

### Musical Aspects
WILL BE ON TESTS!

**Dynamics**: loudness or softness of sound

**Tempo**: the speed at which music is (or should be) played

**Rhythm**: the orgnization of sounds in time

**Timbre**: The distinctive sound of an instrument or voice

**Texture**: sonic layers; the way in which musical sounds are combined

**Melody**: the "tune" in music; comprises a sequence of notes muving in a particular shape

**Musical Form**: the structural orgnization of a piece of music; involves repetition, variation, and contrast

See listening response worksheet, which requires to be filled when listening the music. So we are required to memorize, understand and apply.

# Lec 4 - Jan 16th
**HW - Listening**: twinkle twinkle little star

truncate the phrase and find the beat.

## Rhythm
How can we know about time? That's how it's different from other arts.

defn: change in time that we measure.

- Unmeasured rhythm: approximately mearsure, change the sound without beat, according the the breath
of the performer. Rely on the rest/feeling of the person. Up to musician to feel that piece. Not too surprisingly,
if we listen to them several times, we might feel it is *measured* since our body have the tendency to
feel the beat of it and measure it.
- Measured rhythm: we can measure changing sounds more precisely when we **entrain** them. In entrainment we
synchronize with puslations.

## Instrument Classification
if we classify them based on the *primary sound-producing medium*:
* Chordophone: like guitar. Sound produced by bowing or plucking. Involving chords, strings.
* Aerophone: like flute, harmonica. Sounds produced by blowing.
* Membranophone: like drum. Sound produced by striking a stretched material over a hollow object.
* Idiophone: Sound produced by striking, shaking, waving a solid object. An idiophone is any musical instrument that creates sound primarily by the instrument as a whole vibrating—without the use of strings or membranes.
* Electrophone: sound involving electricity.

We start from Bali in essence.

## Aural Analysis - Balinese Gamelan
Idiophone, Membranophone, Aerophone. Makes the sound more dense, thick textures.

shimmering effect. The entire gamelan is tuned to the same beating. If not, then they need to be tuned.

Key Aesthetic: Ombak (wave)
- paired-tuning
- gong

Five-Tone Selisir Tuning
- nIng 1
- nOng 2
- nEng 3
- nUng 5
- nAng 6

Gong marks the essential structural of the piece.

### Key Features
1. Gong cycle/pattern: use gong to mark the beginning and important points. Bring the music together.
2. Stratification: layering of instrumental parts in increasing density. Usually in ratio, 2:1, 4:1.
3. Interlocking: Rhythmically complementary parts played by pairs of musicians that combine to form a single pattern.
One melody line shared by two people.
    - like one in upbeat, one in downbeat (onbeat).
    - sometimes it's hard for one person to play due to its complex patterns.

# Lec 5 - Jan 21st
Review: Instrument Classification

Leon Theremin: invented Theremin in 1920

The dancing cockatoo is demonstrating an example of measured rhythm since the music
is measured and it is trying to keep the beat... This has some relation with neuroscience...

We ended talking about stratification: idea of layering.

## Interlocking - Kotekan (continued)
**Gangsa**: polos, sangsih: basic, main one, the key (onbeat); the one that follows (upbeat).
(note here the beat pattern here is not always the case.)

**Reyong**: plays on upbeat, downbeat.

The texture is polyphony or herophony (different ways, but we don't need to go into details, lots of debate on this).

## Concept - how people think about music
**Uses** are practical and experimental: to put a baby to sleep, to teach children the alphabet and ... slowly engrained in
our bodies. Use the music for particular reason.

Red Ant Medicineway Ceremony: use music for healing.

There's a time and a place for each use... For most uses music seems to be a force for good but it has a darker side, too.
(to torture (one course here PAC, music and torture, in wars.))

## Merriam's ten functions of music
Memorize them ..
1. Emotional Expression (can convey feelings or ideas - for example in a horror movie the music will follow certain characteristics to intensify the "fear")
2. Communication (music has specific rules like language that follow things like syntax. in our theory class when constructing phrases we referred to them as questions and answers)
3. Symbolic Representation
4. Enforcing Conformity to Social Norms
5. Validation of Social Institutions and Religious Rituals (many cultures of institutions have a song that embodies part of their individaul culture -fight song)
6. Contributes to the continuity and stability of culture
7. contribution to the integration of society
8. aesthetic enjoyment
9. entertainment
10. physical response (listening to fast-paced, upbeat music helps runners to run at a quicker pace)

> Src: [quizlet](https://quizlet.com/8622409/merriams-10-functions-of-music-flash-cards/) the order is slightly different from the one in the lecture.

To consider the use and what is trying to fulfil. Functions are symbolic by nature.

* Indonesia is the largest Islamic nation in the world, both geographically and in terms of population
* Bali is the only province in which Hinduism is  the major region (85% - 90%)

Some regions are not tight with rituals.

Balinese Hindu cosmology conceives of the universe as having three worlds:
- Upper World: gods and ancestors
- Middle World: humans and earthly creature
- Lower World: malevolent spirits

Calendar is also fancy. each month 35 days, different cycles. Sometimes, certain days are aligned
with these type of worlds above. Complex tradition. The music is also categorized in this way.

## Typical Village Temple
Every village has a temple. Each temple has an anniversary date which needs celebrating, honoring. Also, human activities can take place here.

Kaja - north. Kelod - south.

Foot of sacred mountain has a big tempo.

Also, family temple. A piece of land, outer gate. E

Some examples:
- Constructing a taring (a make-shift shelter)
- making satay sticks under the taring
- women making offerings

People do these things in groups, typically not alone.

**suka duka**: happy together, sad together

**gotong royong**: the pratice of mutual help

Last month is the most intensive, lots of work. Family temple anniversary. When you have a group of people coming to help,
you provide food and materials (like bamboos).

*Overlapping sonorities at Temple Anniversary*: short video. Quite interesting for tourists.

### Use of Music
During a Balinese Hindu Ceremony
* to generate energy and strength for activities
* to set and adjust the mood and energy flow
* to contribute to the overall sense of rame
* to signify the progression of events -> specific music heard at each stage
* as an offering to the gods and spirits (i.e., music mediates between the three worlds)

## Art for Art's Sake
*President opens a Bali arts festival*

## Gong Kebyar Competition
Each group represents a particular region. Clap for sth good, boo (or throw tomatoes) for sth bad. You need to have strong performance. They practice about 3-4 months...

The spirit of community and interction are highly valued in Bali. Ritual and musical activities are symbols of communal interdependence.

# Lec 6 - Jan 23rd
## Gamelan Performaces
- Time: don't last all 7 days. last for an hour - 2 (tour performance). Live performance is changing now due to TV and social media.
- Setting: always outdours. Dressed nicely, dressed in the same way.
- Sponsors. Hotel, village.
- Program: depend on context, like tour performance, more exciting, fast tempo. E.g. welcome dance. Typical opening pieces. Also sending off piece. Usually, gong cycle. Sometimes, it's improvised to some circumstances.
- Participants: women, men, children. Separated by ages, gender.
- Audiences: like villagers.

Still thriving. Women are also participating.

## Transmission Process
BALI
- No private study: watch learn, imitate, memorize, assimilate.
- Anyone may study if they have access to instruments (e.g. village gamelan). Not all have access. In fact, they are kept in community hall: open, one wall, pillars. There's stage.
- Some competition to join village ensemble; to join collectives; all members have access to teachers/composers.
- Intensive collective practice; rote imitation, vaisual or aural (mallet as teacher). You watch, learn, then correct themselves.
- Learn by doing: procedural, passive knowledge -> no formal school and minimal theory.
- Benifits: Artistic standard. cultural refinement, socialization, achivement, religious and civic pride.

West
- Private study from young age
- Anyone with means may study; those with talent succeed
- Competition for limite places in teachers' studios
- Intensive practise regimen
- Formalized system of declarative knowledge; teacher encourages student's individuality
- Benifits; Artistic standard, cultural refinement, personal achivement. Similar to Bali.

## Musical Roles
Lead drummer. Lots of communication happening between instruments.

Goal: to contribute a sense of oneness. Sounds like one instrument.

unified musical expression.

unison (not pitches): "The music and musicians must breathe together; they must *menjiwai gending*: feel the soul of the music as one" (Tenzer).

# Lec 7 - Jan 28th
Now let's take a look at an example.

*Ndraje Balendro, Initiation Song*. Horn Ensemble
- Antelope horn and tree-trunk orchestra of the Banda-Linda people
- Central African Republic
- Recorded by ethnomusicologist Simha Arom, ca. 1970

What can we say about it?
**multiple parts**
- polyphonic
- polyrhymic

sounds irregular. In fact, it's very systematic. Every person knows what they need to play.

Overall, they are improvised. They learn from childhood. They are learning stock patterns in their childhood but they are not memorizing it. Deeply engrained, learn from this gradual process. Sth not declared, but pick these things up learning from the people.

**Encultruration**: is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews. (from wiki)

**Improvised**: as mentioned above

**Measured**: details below

**12 pulses or beats**: always grouped into 3 or 4. Since you have polyrhymic, you can easily group them by 3 or 4.

**Multi-track recordings**: He recorded whole thing. Then ask one person to sing his part. Now one melody line. Then ask another person sing based on previous melodic lines. By doing this, music is not chaotic. Though sounds irregular. This is actually a fascinating project.

This is kinda intro to everything.

## CASE STUDY I - Music of the BaAka People
"Makala" BaAka People, Central African Republic

Forest people. Pygmy. Sounds of nature, crickets, washing their clothes, echoes. Uniting these sounds.
Hunt together as part of their culture. African music, you can see lots of drums, since these materials are all available to them.

An album: CAMEROON - Baka Pygmy Music (Field Recordings by Siha Arom and Patrick Renaud)

**uses** and **functions**: What's the use, how to fulfil the function? Uses here are pratical reasons, purposes. However, functions are very symbolic.


### Concept and Social Context for BaAka Music
1. Pleasure. E.g. "The Humming of Bees". Water drum is also an example.
2. Moral and spiritual education, guidance. Learn through education, guidance through life. E.g. "Orycterope and Pangolin"
3. Ritual contexts. Someone is ill, then there's ceremony for that.

### Behaviour and Context for "Makala"
* Who? Everyone has access to making music. All BaAka people. Drums often for men.
* Where? Villages, outdoors. refer to the readings *Locke, “The BaAka People Singing
‘Makala’,” 134–144*.
* How? sit around, and particular procedure.
* When? Evening time.

### Learning Makala (with Michele Kisliuk)
Seize the Dance

# Lec 8 - Jan 30th
## Review
1. The BaAka people consitute one of many groups of:
    - Hunter and gatherers of the equatorial African forest
2. Which statement is true about music among the Forest people in Central Africa like BaAka?
    - Being a musician is open to all
3. What aspects of BaAka people singing make it challenging to study?
    - There are multiple parts, interwoven rhythms, continuous improvised variation
4. What concepts are associated with BaAka music, in particular singing? Name three social contexts discussed in class.
    - Music is made for pleasure and leisure, to teach moral and spiritual education and provide guidance, for specific ritual occasions.

## CASE STUDY II - Brazilian Capoeira
Martial arts. Musician standing around the circle.  Participants: mostly male. There are different schools there. The uniforms (t-shirts) are identity of who they are, where they belong to. They are loyal to their masters.

**History:** where the music comes from: people from Africa. group of people who are not treated as humans, colonizers want to get powers/lands. European powers split into different parts in world. They came to this land, they learnt land is good for agriculture. Initially, it was indigenous people. However, people die from some diseases. So they need some people from Africa. So they bring different music tradition. These Brazil colonizers are Portugueses. Runaway slaves. People come from different African culture.

**Example:** Capoeira (clip from slave to the Rhythm). martial arts is used to defend themselves. The tempo increases slightly. Intensify with the dancing. The moves become more dramatic. Interactions between music and dance. There's leader who control/maintain the intensity of the music.

What do they do before going to the circle? They bow. Formality before combat. You recognized each other. Also, there are different phases.

### Instruement
berimbau: 1 string. You can change the sound by hitting/striking.

Three berimbau in an ensemble
- low: basic pattern
- middle: complementary pattern
- high: ornamentation, improv

Atabaque
- 1--&3-4- (low- -low low- slap)

Other instruments - steady groove

Voice - primary melody (Portugueses)

### Key features
- call-and-response
- polyrhymic texture
- dynamic level typically constant
- gradual increase in tempo
- rhythmic complexity and density increase with increasing intensity

Be familiar with the listening guide.

### Performance Process
- space: Context in gym. Can be in school. You can find Capoeira competition everywhere.
- participants: Men and women can both participate. Things changed in last decade.
- formality: bow before
- 3 section
- music-dance interaction
> refer to the readings...

**Example:** Ginga - Capoeira. Move you leg back, move arm and ... don't cover eyes, remain eye contacts, look at each other.

> People/music/tradition is not frozen. In this class, we are going to think question in different ways. As a musician, you might carry these ideas from you.

## katajja & Tanya Tagaq

The sounds are artefact of culture. The concepts behind that is not changed.

### Concept and Context for katajja
men hunt. women stay at home. They play this together: throat singing. People also do this as lullaby. There could also be some meaning tied to that. Also, sounds of snow blowing.

- Traditional performance
- new performance: modernized. Politically motivated.

# Lec 9 - Feb 4th
continue from last class... Tanya Tagaq, her music is not traditional. Her music is open possiblities to ask about: where does the sound come from? So, she says that this is the way that people can learn more. Let's listen to *Demo by Inuit sisters Karin and Kathy Kettler (Northern Quebec, Canada)*.
> From AlakskaDispatch.com. They are Inuit throat singner and drum dancer. Competition between girls while men in hunting. Half second off each other. Comes from voices, throats, breathing. Part of culture they from, very unique. Oral tradition, cannot learn from written down notes.

Another video: [*The sounds of Throat Singing (Tangya Tagaq)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNb2ZDjeiU4).
> small examples. Deep part from exhalation. Difficult, you need to learn how to displace the notes from high to low. Make deep sounds going in. Hard to teach yourself, you need to learn for a while.
