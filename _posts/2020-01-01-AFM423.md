 > I was auditing this course during this term.

This course seems to be interesting, and prof can even override you to this course without prereq since
the contents of this course do not require those knowledge that much...

As you can find in notes, the course gives some applications of AI in finance...

I will no longer audit it due to the math tutor duty... You can find me in MC 3022 this term when I am tutoring.
