    <h2 style="color:white;"> Monteverdi to Mozart: Music from 1600-1800 </h2>

I enrolled in this course at the beginning of the term, then I dropped due to the time conflict with [cs 145](../CS145/). At that time, I think auditing cs 145 is more important than my music minor degree. Then after I realized I can't learn much from auditing cs 145, it's really a bad choice to drop music 254.

For the next offering after this (Winter 2020), I couldn't select this course anymore due to my maximum course load... (I try to petition for enroll 7 courses but I failed...) Moreover, after the schedule is out (for Winter 2020), there is a time conflict between music 254 and co 255. Of course, at this time, I have to choose co 255 over music 254 to fufill my co schedule (co 450 in Fall 2020). Sad... But I will take music 256! Not sure if I can take 254 in the future, let's wait and see.
