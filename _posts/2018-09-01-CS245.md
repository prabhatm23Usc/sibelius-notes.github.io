 > I was auditing this course during this term.

Taught by Carmen Bruni, who has a complete set of notes on his website.

## boring lec 1

 * introduce yourself (always same as before, but interesting)



### what cs245 is about?

 * First order logic
 * and its applications

### what is logic

 ​	see the slide. I don't bother to type it out.

### why study logic

 ​	same as above

### prolog

 ​	PROgramming with LOGic

### proposition

 ​	A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either *true* or **false**

### some random things Carmen wrote on the board

 For an integer  \\(x, x>5\\) , is this a proposition?

 * The whole thing is.

### Examples of non-proposition

 ​	hmm, see the slides.

### Rest...

 ​	I will wait to type sth until I find sth interesting...

### wow, Carmen wrote sth on the board

 Propositional Variables

 ​	c: She is clever

 ​	h: She is hard working

 ps: sorry, I didn't learn how to type out logic signs...

 Oh, I found that. What he wrote on the board is \\((c\ \wedge\ (\lnot \ h))\\) . I am clever...

\\[\begin{aligned}
x&=y \\
y&=z \\
\\]


## lec end...

 Since I heard that this course no longer needs iclicker, I don't need to help my friend Fannie to do the clicker question. Now this is the end of this course.

 But wait a sec, I will learn cs245e by myself. Maybe I will develop a set of notes to help me.
