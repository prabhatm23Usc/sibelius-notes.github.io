    <h2 style="color:white;"> Music rudiments </h2>
---

Over the years, this course is taught by [Trevor Wagler](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-music/faculty-profiles/trevor-wagler/index.html): French horn player and orchestrator. He is passionate about what he is teaching.

To be honest, this course is extremely easy if you have **a** little background. So it is `for students with minimal musical background` from the official description.

Also note that it does not fulfil Music major or minor requirements though it can boost your average. If you have strong musical background, take [music 270](/18-01/MUSIC270/) instead. 270 starts with a little bit rudiments and then jumps to the harmony part.
