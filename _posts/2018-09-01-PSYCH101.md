Dropped because I thought I couldn't manage so many things in a term. However, until now, I think there is nothing unmanageable... I might take it again during spring 2020.

**Update from S20**: due to covid-19, I take [pmath 347](/pmath/347) instead. To satisfy social science requirements, I plan to take SMF 211 and ECON 212 later.
