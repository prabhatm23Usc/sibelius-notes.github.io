So I just want to get a feel how this course looks like. Pretty much Lushman's cs 146's style: lots of things, hard, time-consuming, but learn a lot definitely.

About 50% more contents than cs 246... and the final project is VIM (if they didn't change it).

Start the assignments early and go to office hours.
