Taught by Parisa Bohlouli-Zanjani, (here email: [p2bohlou@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:p2bohlou@uwaterloo.ca)). Couldn't find the profile in physics website...

If she could teach me phys 111, it would be awesome...

# Remarks
This course deliberately avoid the proofs and derivations of formulas, then the only thing left is to apply the right formula to the question without any further understanding.
