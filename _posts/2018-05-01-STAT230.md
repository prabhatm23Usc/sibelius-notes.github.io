They deliberately made the exams (midterms and final) hard... Some years ago (at least before 2018), this course is considered as a bird course.

Just understand every problem in all chapters.

Oh, if you want to take advanced (stat 240), not that it will only be offered during Fall. The concepts are much much more abstract, like sample spaces, probability spaces, closed sets. FAIRLY ABSTRACT. Then you would be interested in stat 901: Theory of Probability 1.
