They deliberately made the exams (midterms and final) hard... Some years ago (at least before 2018), this course is considered as a bird course.

Just understand every problem in all chapters.

Don't have complete notes to share. They have slides.

Oh, if you want to take advanced (stat 240), not that it will only be offered during Fall. The concepts are much much more abstract, like sample spaces, probability spaces, closed sets. FARILY ABSTRACT.
