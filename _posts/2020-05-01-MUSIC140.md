[Detailed notes](/md/1205/music140).

Taught by [Simon Wood](https://uwaterloo.ca/music/people-profiles/simon-wood), who is teaching part-time. This course is really like a story-telling course. It's extremely interesting. In this pandemic version, only four term test, each of them covers 3 weeks' contents. If you really paid attention to the material, marks will not be bad. Also, you will be interested in his [music 246](/music/246).
