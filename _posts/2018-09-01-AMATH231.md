[ERV](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ervrscay) was teaching that. He has [a complete set of notes](http://links.uwaterloo.ca/amath231). The course is not that hard if you do all assignments. Assignments and exams are similar.

[Here](/pdfs/1189/231.pdf) is a summary.

> Side note: He is great and passionate, but the style of [amath 391](/19-01/AMATH391/) is quite different: midterm is much harder than assignments.
