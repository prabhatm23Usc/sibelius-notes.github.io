He repeated the recurrence example for four times... spent so much time on calculation, didn't enrich a lot. He did introduced some new topics in enumeration like tilings, but nothing in graph theory, or even less than math 239... This is more structured with [Kevin](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~kpurbhoo/), but much more difficult with assignments and tests, but you have the curve at the end.

[Here](/pdfs/1189/math249.pdf) is the complete notes.

The following courses are CO 342/442, CO 330/430.
