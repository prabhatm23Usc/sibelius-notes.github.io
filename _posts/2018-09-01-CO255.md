 > I was auditing this course during this term.

[Jim Geelen](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~jfgeelen/). Legend. Spent 2~3 lectures on introduction of the course topics and how hard is optimization...

From a review of rate my prof:
> Covers so many topics in an intro to CO course as he is such a smart professor. Difficult assignment, better start assignment early and go to his office hour. When I went to higher level CO courses, I realized how great he is. His class is hard, but makes your life easier in future CO courses.

For example, co 450 students serve the best if they took co 255.

I didn't audit anymore since I can't follow the lectures without doing any assignments. [Here](/pdfs/1189/co255.pdf) are the partial notes.
