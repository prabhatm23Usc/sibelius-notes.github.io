 > I was TAing this course during this term.

Just marking their quizzes.

This course is about half Vector Calculus (amath 231), half complex analysis (pmath 332/352). Extremely basic, since engineers take math for granted.

Also note that engineers use \\(j\\) instead of \\(i\\) for imaginary numbers (to distinguish it from the current).
