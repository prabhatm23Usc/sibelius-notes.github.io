Harsh TA, made the average around 40 for the first 2 assignments. This is different from normal advanced courses. Let's look at a marking example:
> We are required to draw to plots in a same graph. Then I forgot to draw one of them. Then I got 1/3. -1 for not drawing the second one, -1 for not drawing these two together.

This course is required for AMATH major or minor or joint(?), but you can discuss with advisor if your coop sequence
cannot make this course.

[Here](/pdfs/1189/251.pdf) is a summary. [Here](/pdfs/1189/amath251.pdf) is complete notes (a lot of copying...).
