# Baroque Era
* end of 16c to mid 18c
* Baroque: Negative connotations
    * Barocco
    * 1734
    * 1768: disonances create tension
    * 19C
    * Late 19C
    * 1950s: used to describe era.
* Contradictions:
    * Music: break with immediate past
    * Absolute monarch patrons of music
    * 17C-early 18C: bloody wars
* 1st half 17C
* some well-known composers born late

## Difference between Renaissance & Baroque
Micheelangelo, David: static
Bernini, David: motion, emotion

**Baroque Sculpture**: drama, virtuosity, emotion. See examples in textbook.

**Baroque Music**: drama, virtuosity, emotion!
* Some examples



CLASS CANCELLED THIS THURS JAN 9!

As said last time, the class is cancelled.

# Music of the early Baroque: Characteristics of a New Era

## 3 streams in Baroque & 3 streams in Classical eras
a) Vocal music

b) rise of the violin family: foundation of orchstra

c) keyboard music

## General Characteristics of Baroque Music
1. Texture
    - treble-bass polarity: two different threads
    - basso continuo: emphasize bass part, foundation of music.
        - only bass line.
        - improvised. They would understand and then improvise.
        - figured bass notation. Up to performer to fill it up.
        - Later Baroque often 2 instruments:
            - bass line + chords: keyboard or plucked instrument  like organ, lute, theorbo (long extension to have bass sound.)
            - bass line: reinforced by bassoon...
    - combining voices and intruments: colors. New thing.
        - Different instrument has different tuning system. String instruments can be adjusted easily, but not the case with keyboard.
        - independent tuning systems:
            - mean-tone for keyboard.
        - equal temperament (compromise). Take the octave and divide it by 12 equal semitones.
2. Harmony

They are not thinking major minor, instead, modal music previously. Bass oriented and build it up. More types of dissonances (clashes) were permitted.

3. Rhythm
    - bar lines and time signatures.
    - contrast and pairing: improvised rhythm in prelude, but strict in fugue.

4. Emotion
    - Affections: states of mind, such as sadness, joy.
    - Relatively stable. Cause body fluids in bounds.
    - arouse affections
    - embellishment: emotional impact. Not written in.


### Dramatic Shift in Musical Practice
Claudio Monteverdi
- 5th book of Madrigals
- 5-voices madrigal: polyphonic setting of a 16C Italian poem
- Breaking rules of dissonances for dramatic effect
- word painting
    - using musical gestures
        - cruda (cruel)
        - jeering laughter

#### Bitter Debate: Artusi vs Monteverdi
Monteverdi: build on the previous foundation

First Practice: Monteverdi's term.
- Zarlino & Artusi
- rules: dissonances. Carefully prepared and resolved.
- Palestrina: benchmark

Second Practice: more modern. Cruda (cruel)

# The Birth of Opera
## Camerata
Caccini, singer in the group

1570s & 80s.
- discussed literature, science & arts
- Members: V. Galilei (father of Gallieo Galilei)...
- Greek tragedy as model. really move people
- speculated on role of music in ancient theatre
- Criticized current vocal polyphony. can't understand the word. Somewhere between song and speech.
- Developed Monody: accompanied solo singing.
    - texture? solo song + 1 instrument. bass continuo

## Caccini I'll see my sun
style is very different, example of monody. Prototype of recitative(宣叙调): made opera possible.

repetition not happened in recitatives. but you have time to pause in opera.

## Opera & its antecendents
opera = italian for work = drama with music

## antecendents
1. pastroal drama (1471, Florence: on Orfeo)
2. madrigals: emotion, dramatizing poetry
3. Intermedio: interesting invention: musical interlude on a pastroal, allegorical or myyhological subjects before, after between acts of play

Most famous one: Florence, 1589 for a wedding of Grand Duke...

Orpheus: musician. rock beat. not a happy guy.

## Recitative
Peri's recitative style (see textbook source reading)

halfway between singing and speaking (speech). no repetition, through composed. Words are clear, and vocal line are written to reflect the words.

stressed syllables: consonant with bass.

Caccini: lots of repetition of text, ornamations. but this is different. has own opera. Published before Peri's (rival...)

aria or recitative, are mostly accompanied by bass continuo.

## 2 exerpts: 2 styles of monody used in Peri's opera, L'Euridice
a) Tirsi's song "Nel pur ardor"
- aira = "air" or song
- more strict rhythm because of dance music, dance rhythm
- very charming...
- Introduced by Sinfonia.
- pastroal style
    - compoound lilting meter (6/4)
    - drone
    - 2 recorders with lilting
    - Parallel 3rds motion

b) Dafne (new style)
* employs bass continuo
* mirrors speech
* syllabic setting: one note per syllable

Lots of repeated notes. In the score, only bass line and voice. Lots of words are in B-flat, which is similar to
our speech, monotone. Candence, end of phrase. Sheppard is coming after her.

- Dafne
- Orfeo's reaction: breathless then grief (unprepared dissonances, hold over notes, unexpected harmonic progressions)

this expressive recitative: ability to melt the words, emotitions.

## Monteverdi - L'Orfeo
Monteverdi did sth different. 40 when coming to opera. Great gig, works for Italian family (rich powerful).
Grew up in very difficult time when getting the gig.

- first opera
- libretto: Allssandro Striggio
- first performance: Mantua
- private entertainment: room in apartments of Gonzaga family
- modelled on Peri but musically & dramatically more effective
    - expanded Rinuccini's 5 scences to prologue + 5 acts. Grab the same story.
    - recitative: more varied than Peri's. More variations.
    - Orchestra: larger, more variety, specific instrument.
- story based on Orpheus legend.
- Characters:
    - allegorical
    - pastroal
    - underworld
    - Euridice, Orfeo, Sylvia (messenger)
    - Chorus: empathizes the character. very important function
    - Orchestra

### Act II excerpt
a) Orfeo's aria

Music:
- regular dance rhythm
- strophic
- only voice + bass continuo

He is just so happy. Strong rhythm. Joy.

- ritornello: "refrain"
    - 5 parts

b) short shepherd's song

c) Messenger's recitative
- Dialogues: horrorable expression on her face. Back and forth. When messenger arrives... Another shepherd wants to interject, bring to his understanding.
    - basso continuo: switch to wooden pipe organ & theorbo
- Messenger narrates death of Euridice.
    - varied style: straight narration -> highly emotive.
    - Music: more chromatic, jarring.

d) Orfeo's lament (哀叹)
- barely speak
- basso continuo: wooden pipe organ & theorbo, again... specify this specific dialogue.
- chromatic, dissonant, jarring.
- word painting: "goodbye earth.."
    - sudden plunge

e) Chorus: Greek chorus
* Part I: share grief. bassline takes the initial melody, share the grief.
* Part II: moral of drama.

# Early Baroque Vocal Music for Church and Chamber: Strozzi, Carissimi, Schutz
Babara Strozzi (1619-1677): interesting character. early 17C. Probably natural daughter of Giulio Strozzi. Only women to the groups (literature arts science and so on). Sing beautifully. Amazing women. One of most prolific composers of vocal chamber music.

Venice
## Strozzi

Her Cantata (Lagrime mie)
- Cantata: piece to be sung (Italian)
- secular, not meant for church
- one voice with basso continuo
- private. For her all amazing singing, no opera or public.
- poetry: free form. male perspective.
- several secions of recitative, arioso (somewhere between aira and recitative), aria ~ narrative & lyrical poetry
- softened recitative style

### Form:
- mm1-22: lament: recitative, long melismas (“tears”, “pain”, “heart”)
- mm23-48: narration about Lidia:
    - arioso: style of singing that approaches the lyricism of aria but is freer in form
- mm49-62: descending bass line, triple meter, long melisma (“weep”)
- mm63-70: opening lament returns
- mm71-87: strophic aria (4X 8-syllable lines)
- mm 88-96: recitative
- mm97-end: triple meter, descending bass line (repeated)
- [+ mm 1-22: repeats opening lament]

every single section, she's applying techniques from early opera.

- word-painting/text depiction: opening lament (conventional devices: opening recitative: weeping, sobbing)
    - long melisma on “La-grime”
    - minor mode: E minor
    - dissonances: D♯ F♯ over E
    - augmented intervals: D♯-C♮: notes of harmonic minor scale
    - descending line on 'La': falling tears. In Baroque, it usually means death, sad.


Now go to Rome.

## Carissimi
Giacomo Carissimi (1605-1674): 1629: Master of the chapel & teacher at Jesuit college in Rome
- described as "musical orator"; patron; musical works protected by decree of Popes
- Archives destroyed in 1773 crackdown on Jesuits & Napoleon's raids
- Oratorios written for the Archoconfraternita del SS Concifrisso

not performed in church.

### Oratorio
- ORATORIO: “oratorio” (Italian) = prayer hall (named for where performed & groups met)
- religious dramatic music for outside church: incl. narrative, dialogue & commentary
- Only musical performances allowed during Lent (religious event)
- text: Latin or Italian
- operatic: recitatives, arias, instrumental preludes & ritornellos.

but how is it different from opera?
- sacred subject matter
- not staged: nattared (sung): describe action
- greater role to chorus

Particular work
### NAWM 80: Carissimi, Historia di Jephte (Story of Jephte, ca. 1648)
- Latin: paraphrased biblically based story (from Judges)

Promise: if wins the war, first person come sacrifices, but it's his daughter singing happily.

a) solo recitative [+ echo]: daughter (filia), “Plorate colles” (Weep, Hills), from final scene
- Basso continuo: theorbo
- Echo: 2 singers (2 friends) biting harmonies
- lament: long recitative + arioso passages
- repeated words/phrases
- flatten melodic pitches: pathos
- harmony: expressive dissonances

b) Chorus: “Plorate filii Israel” (Weep, Sons of Israe)
- 6-voice chorus
- Repeats last 4 lines of daughter's lament
- Opening: bass line descends twice through 4ths
    - gesture of lament
- downward movement all voices, lots of tension.
- dissonances: suspensions: pile up at end of section

new invention of 17th century. Operatic someways, not staged, but ok for that time.

## Heinrich Schütz
Wealthy. German composers, very influenced. Influenced by two different composers, Gabrieli and Monteverdi (in 1628).
- Studied with G. Gabrieli in Venice, 1609-1612.
- (1585-1672): 1615-72: master of chapel of Elector of Saxony, Dresden
- 1618-48: 30 Years War

### NAWM81: Saul, was verfolgst du mich? (ca. 1650) (Saul, why do you persecute me?)
- Post-war collection of Symphoniae sacreae
    - used full force of Dresden chapel
- **Sacred Concerto** = grand concerto in Gabrieli's Venetian style:
    - large-scale work, mixing voices & instruments
    - style: merges Gabrieli’s polychoral style with Monteverdi’s expressiveness
        - e.g. Gabrieli *In Ecclesiis*: 4 solos, 4-part chorus, 6 part instrumental ensemble, organs. Many styles: modern aira, late 16C polyphony.
- based on Paul (Saul)'s conversation
- Schutz's score:
    - 2 violins
    - 6 solo voices (SSATBB)
    - 2 X 4-voice choirs (doubled by instruments)
    - bass continuo (organ + cello/theorbo for recitative sections)

* form:
    - sectional: exploits forces & dramatizes text:
    - mm1-16: "Saul, Why do you persecute me?”
        - 4 pairs of solos rise from depths
        - D minor - A minor - F major - D major
        - “persecute” (“verfolgst”): intense dissonance. Not bright.
    - mm 17-23: chorus & solos: grand concerto style
        - echoes: dynamics (f - mp - pp). Want to sound like echo via dynamics.
        - D major
    - mm21-23: Short 6/8 meter & G major/minor: distortion of echoes?
    - m.24: recitative style:
        - solo voice + basso continuo (“it will be difficult for you”)
        - Passed from Tenor – Alto
        - "Kick": ornamental turn
    - m.34: choral refrain “Saul...”
    - m. 39: recitative material in imitation
        - “kick”: now a long melisma. lots of notes.
    - m.60: recitative & polychoral styles combined
        - grows in intensity and ends in pianissimo echo
* Musical figures:
    - In Baroque, melodic pattern or contrapuntal effect conventionally employed to convey the meaning of a text
    - Codified by Schutz's text
    - break old rules, but give a name what gestures mean. 2 examples. Not accidentals.
        - harsh cadential notes
        - harsh leap

# Baroque Instrumental Music I: the Violin Family – Marini, Corelli, Vivaldi
## 2 main string families in Baroque:
Viol family
- Viola da gambda (=viola of the leg)
    - invented in Spain, late 15C
    - 6 strings
    - frets, like guitar
    - bowed underhand, creates different sound
    - different size
    - violone (big viol) by 1600 - persisted as continuo instrument
    - used in court & chamber music

Violin Family
- Viola "da braccio" (=arm): violin & viola
    * violin, viola, violoncello
    * emerged independent of viols
    * 4 strings (tuned in 5th) - ca. 1550
    * no frets
    * overhand bow
    * early use for dancing

Note the difference between Baroque Violin and modern Violin.

missed due to the <s>**shit**</s> interview... To be filled later

## Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741)
- son of St Mark's violinist (Venice)
- conductor, composer, priest, teacher: Ospedale della Pieta, Venice (1703-40)
- 1737: censured for behaviour; died pauper
- He wrote a lot of instrumental music, but he also write 49 operas, and direct by himself.

## Concerto
= composition in which one or more solo instruments (or instrumental group) contrast with an orchestral ensemble
- concerto grosso: contrast between group of soloist (concertino) (as opposed to one)  & whole orchestra
- solo concerto: contrast between a single soloist & whole orchestra

### Example: Concerto for Violin in A Minor, Op.3, no.6
**Solo Concerto**:
- 3 movements: fast - slow - fast
- fast movements: Ritornello Form
    - standard form for fast movements in concertos
    - featuring a ritornello (refrain) for full orchestra
    - alternates with episodes characterized by virtuosic material played by one or more soloist

**Ritornello** = refrains
- is a recurring passage in Baroque music for orchestra or chorus. (from wiki)

**Episodes** = passages featuring soloist between ritornellos

Middle movement is different.
1. Allegro: A minor
2. Largo cantabile: D minor
3. Presto: A minor

# Baroque Instrumental Music: Keyboard Music: Instruments, Composers, Forms & Styles
## Keyboard Instruments
- Harpsichord: keyboard instruement popular 15C - 18C; strings plucked by quill. Doesn't have wide range but you can combine two to create different sounds.
- Clavichord:
    - popular 15C - 18C
    - brass tangent strikes string
    - stays in contact as long as key depressed
    - loudness controlled by player
    - unlike piano or harpsichord, it has tangent. you can control the sound quality of the string.
    - quite small in 17th C. Not for a big group of people, maybe at home.
    - more like a lute, guitar, since plucke the string. Mechanically by a keyboard.

**Girolamo Frescobaldi**: popular, well-known during his life time. But he is also organist. Teach Harpsichord. He also wrote some Toccata.

## Italian Keyboard Toccata
**Toccata**: Italian "touched"
- for keyboard or lute. Sounds like improvised
- may contain imitative sections (repeating melodic material in another part or parts)
- style: improvisatory, exploratory, virtuosic, free-sounding
    - player explores a range of harmonies & figurations
    - often played as preludes to other pieces
    - clearly defined the mode/key of following piece.

*1615: Toccatas and Partitas Intabulated for Harpsichord, Book I*
* 1st conceived exclusively for keyboard
* Idiomatically suited to harpsichord
    * fits easily under 2 hands
    * avoided long sustained sounds

### Frescobaldi, *Toccata No.3*
* harpsichord
* maintains forward momentum: from constant motion, evaded candences; restless character
* Typical: series of brief phrases or sections
    - each closed with a cadence, distinct figuration
* Style shifts frequently
    * Opening: like recitative
    * m.5: like Arioso: chains of suspensions over walking bass
    * mm.8-11: imitative passage
    * rest of the piece: shifts every 2 or 3 bars
    * Improvised sound
    * Also improvised ornaments

## French Baroque Suite
**Elisabeth-Claude Jacquet de la Guerre** (1665-1729)
- French
- harpsichordist & composer
- 1687: 1st publication – works for harpsichord
- chlid prodigy: age 5 sang & performed at court of Louis XIV
- Paris: gave lessons & concerts
- very accomplished women

### Suite No. 3 in A Minor, *Pièces de clavecin* [Pieces for Harpsichord], Book I (ca 1687)
* Suite
    - collection of stylized dances
    - from trend of pairing dance types
    - contrasting tempos & character
    - NOT danced: psychological states
* Form: most dances in binary ||: A :||: B :||

prelude:
- improvisatory
- slurs...: sustained notes, phrase groupings
- no bar lines, no time signature
- explores key

allemande: "German"
- moderate 4/4 meter; begins with upbeat
- 8th & 16th note
- picardy third at the end  

courante:
- Moderate 3 or compound meter; begins with upbeat
- Hemiola: shifts between 3/2 & 6/4

sarabande
- slow
- dignified
- triple meter, emphasis on 2nd beat

gigue (jig)
- (England/Ireland)
- fast, compound meter 6/4
- bach has been doing this

### Ornamentation (argrements)
* Harpsichord imitating lute (style luthe): Borrowed figuration & practice
* Pratical reasions for ornaments on harpsichord?
    - sound only has short period of time. So to compensate for decaying sound of plucked strings
    - emphasizes notes.
* Artistic reasons?
    - Aesthetic
    - taste
    - Performer can add ornaments (acc. to taste)
* notes inegales: "uneven notes": 17C French convention of performing passages of short notes of even duration by alternating longer and shorter notes to create a lilting rhythm

Some common French ornaments: Pince. Tremblement. Double. Port de voix.

## GERMANY: ORGAN PRELUDE
**Organ**
instrument consisting of a number of pipes that sound tones when supplied with pressurized air & a keyboard that operates a mechanism controlling the flow of air to the pipes
- Ranks of pipes engaged by stops; one pitch/pipe
- One or more manuals & pedal board
- Pre-electricity: one person operated bellows.
- continuously supply of wind, so long sustained notes possible

You can hold a note for years...

1650-1750: Golden age of Lutheran German organ music

### Dietrich Buxtehude
- 1668-1707: Organist, St Mary’s Church in Lübeck (N. Germany)
- didn't publish his works; found after his death
- Abendmusiken (free evening concerts during Advent)
    - 1705-6: JS Bach visited, walked 378 kms
- Liturgical Function: Sunday services:
    - started with large Prelude for organ, as well as preludes for other portions of the service
    - BuxWV141: probably prelude to service; challenge for organ students

#### NAWM 97: Praeludium in E major, BuxWV 141
- late 17th century
- organ (2 manuals + pedal)
- Praeludium (Latin = Prelude)
    - = Toccata: free & imitative/fugal sections alternate
    - = Series of short sections in free style alternating with longer ones in imitative counterpoint
- virtuosic: keyboards & pedals
- suggest improvisation
- imitative/fugal sections have related themes
- 4 imitative/fugal sections preceded by free sections
- Free Fugue Free Fugal/Figurative Fugal Trans Fugue Coda

actual music is half step higher than the score

# J.S. Bach I: Instrumental Music
**J S Bach**: church gigues. didn't write opera...

## Review of Fugue
* **FUGUE**: a musical genre based on the systematic imitation of a theme
* **IMITATION**: texture of independent musical lines (as opposed to homophonic)
* **VOICES**: independent musical lines representing different ranges
    * usually no more than 4 (SATB)
    * ranges on a keyboard or in an orchestra
* **EXPOSITION**: opening section of a fugue where each voice states the entire theme *once*
    * **SUBJECT**: the main theme of a fugue, the musical “idea”
    * **ANSWER**: a statement of the subject in the exposition starting on a different note
        * usually the 2nd and 4th statement of the subject
    * **COUNTERSUBJECT**: a theme that is played/sung at the same time as the subject
        * usually stated by a voice that has already stated the subject
    * The exposition ends once all the voices have stated the subject once only

*WHAT FOLLOWS THE EXPOSITION?*
* Alternation of
    * **EPISODES**: sections without statements of the subject
    * **STATEMENTS OF THE SUBJECT**: one or two voices state the subject
    * **MODULATIONS**: go through many different keys before returning to the tonic

## NAWM 102: Bach, Prelude & Fugue in A Minor
- for organ
- ca. 1715: Weimar
**Main points:**
1. pair of pieces
    * free & fugal: no more alternating sections
2. idomatic writing borrowed from another genre/instruement
    - influence of Italian concerto composers: like Vivaldi
    - Prelude: violinsitic figuration
    - fugue subject: like ritornello form of concertos
        - episodes like solo sections; return of subject like ritornellos

### Prelude
- A minor
- mm 1-24: violin-like figuration; descends choramatically
- mm 37-8: chains of suspensions (like Corelli!)

### Fugue
Exposition
- violin-like subject
- 4 voices
- order of voices: soprano alto tenor bass

Episodes

1st Episode
- structure
    - like 1st movement of concerto
- elaborate cadenza (like concerto)
- other things Bach does with fugue:
    - Fugue subject in subsequence statements:
        - use stretto: when one voice enters with fugue subject before a previous voice is done
    - varies the fugue subject
    - only states part of subject (e.g., 2nd half)
    - starts in one voices, complete in another

## Bach's Music for Harpsichord
- Well-tempered Clavier (German: das wohltemperierte Clavier): WTC Book 1: 1722 & WTC Book 2: 1740
- Pairs of Preludes & Fugues for keyboard
    - All 24 keys (major followed by parallel minor from C to B)
- Tuning system
    - near-equal temperament vs. mean-tone
    - made it possible to play in every key

## NAWM 104: Bach, Prelude & Fugue No. 8, Well-Tempered Clavier Book I
- Demonstrates new tuning system well:
    - Prelude: E♭ minor (6 flats)
    - Fugue: D♯ minor (6 sharps)
    - Enharmonic equivalents: entire spectrum of notes in WTC
- Both adapted from previous work

### Pedagogical aims in Well-Tempered Clavier Book I

- Prelude
    - Specific techniques, like etude
    - Performance conventions & compositional practices:
    - No. 8: Italian concerto slow movement or French sarabande?
        - repeated chords on almost every beat
        - large leaps
        - Ornamentation, like french: dotted
        - **cosmopolitan mixture: typical of Bach**
- Fugue
    - Various techniques of fugal writing & treatment of subject:
        - Almost omnipresent fugue subject
        - Very few episodes & short
        - constant variation of subject
        - augmentation, inversion, stretto (overlapping entrances of subject)
        - coda
    - Fugue subject & exposition:
        - Subject: “old-fashioned”: narrow range
        - 3-voice fugue: Alto, Soprano, Bass (m.8). Instead of 4.
        - starting at middle

# Bach’s Vocal Music
## NAWM 105: Bach, Cantata BWV 62, Nun Komm, der Heiden Heiland, 1st movement
(Now Come, Saviour of the Heathens/Gentiles)

### Liturgical Function & Text:
- 1st performance: Dec. 3, 1724 [1st Sunday of Advent: before Xmas]
- between Gospel reading & sermon
- chorale text by Martin Luther:
    - uses 1st & last of 8 stanzas in choruses
    - Luther adapted Catholic Latin chants
- text for rest of cantata (recitatives & arias): unknown author – paraphrased stanzas 2-7

Extra src: [Texts of all movements](http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Texts/BWV62-Eng3P.htm)

### Genre: Chorale cantata
= sacred setting of a Lutheran hymn (& related poetry) incorporating chorus, orchestra, soloists
- chorale = a Lutheran hymn; congregation familiar with hymn
- Drew on wide range of styles & genres (Bach's ablility to assimilate)
- Wrote in every genre BUT opera!
    - but he uses the components of Italian opera:
        - arias, recitatives (accompanied & dry), choruses, orchestra
- cantata provides maximum variety:
    - solos: feature song types of contemporary opera
    - moving from complex to simple
- Instruments used in the cantata:
    - horn, 2 oboes, violin 1, violin 2, viola + basso continuo (organ & violone)

### Overall Form of the Cantata
quite typical form

1. Chorale Motet (chorus): b minor1st verse of Luther’s hymn (see next page)
    - (*you will only be tested on movement 1*)
2. Da capo aria (ABA) with orchestra (tenor): G major
    - style of a minuet
    - B: contrast, minor mode
    - long melismas (as long as 20 bars)
3. Recitative with continuo only (bass)
    - Angular, wide leaps
    - Text painting: "run" displays a 16th-note run; "fallen" - large leap down
4. Da capo aria (ABA) with continuo & unison orchestra (bass): D major
    - violins & violas play same as bassline but octave higher
    - B: contrast, minor mode (b & f#)
5. Accompanied Recitative (soprano & alto): modulates through keys to b minor
6. Chorale harmonization (chorus): b minor -- Last verse (8) of Luther’s hymn
    - 4-part harmony (SATB): doubled by instruments
    - last verse (8) of the Luther's hymn

## No. 1: opening chorus
most complex & weightiest movement of the cantata

= CHORALE MOTET: setting of a chorale in the style of a 16C motet (polyphonic vocal piece)

Combines: a) new & b) old techniques


a) NEW: ritornello structure & instrumental concerto style (like Vivaldi)
- mm1-16: opening instrumental ritornello – repeated at end
- ritornellos: frame 4 phrases of chorale (like solo episode)

    - also includes some statements of chorale (mm 3-5: bass, 15-17: oboes)

b) OLD: Cantus-firmus\*: soprano & horn present chorale tune in long notes (m. 22, etc)
- Alto, Tenor & Bass: imitative counterpoint beneath soprano line
    - m.17, etc: Alto Tenor Bass sing imitation based on chorale

\* Cantus firmus: “fixed melody”: existing melody on which a new polyphonic work is based; melody presented in long notes

### Summary

# Late Baroque Opera
in France & England: Lully & Purcell

## Baroque Opera in France
- under Louis XIV: dominated by Lully & Quinault
- resisted following Italy. love hate relationship with Italy.
- national French Opera Style: influenced by 2 strong Fren traditions:
    - court ballet: "passacaille"
    - theatre: classical tragedy
- poetry & drama given priority on stage
- opera = *tragédie en musique –> tragédie lyrique*

**Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-87)**
- king was impressed by his dance, then play a role in his court. Then become more involved.
- exclusive right to write operas.

### tragédie lyrique
:(lyric tragedy) = French 17C & 18C form of opera, pioneered by Lully, combining French classical drama & ballet with music, dance and spectacle

**features**:
- classical French drama, ballet, French song tradition & new recitative
- dramatic structure:  prologue + 5 acts
- plots: mythology, gods
- orchestra: all strings (24 violins): 5 parts, some winds & long ritornello
- dramatic eloquence over vocal brilliance
- static monologue airs (arias)
- spectacular choruses & dancing

### Lully, Armide, 1686
Armide: Princess of Damascus, sorceress

Renaud: crusader knight, put into magic sleep
- Armide puts spell on him to fall in love with here & abandon his crusade
- saved by 2 fellow knights (diamond shield)
- resumes his quest & she destroyes her realm

ActII/sc5: intends to kill him but finds herself unable

Let's examine some components.

a) **Overture** = (opening) an orchestral piece introducing an opera or other long work
- typical French overture:
- in 2 parts: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ||: A:||: B :||

A:
- slow, duple meter, majestic quality
- homophonic
- 2 performance pratices:
    - dotted rhythms (overdotting): dotted note held longer than written, while short one is shortened
    - notes inegales (unequal notes)

B:
- faster tempo, compound triple meter (6/4)
- imitative entrances
- end of B: slower tempo & duple meter, majestic

Divertissement (diversion) at center of every act:
- extended episodes: songs, chorues, instrumental dances. aimed at pleasing audience

b) **Act II, sc 4: Divertissement (conclusion):** Laissons au tendre amour (Let tender love)
- long interlude of ballet, solo airs, choral singing, &spectacle, intended as entertainment
- Form: prelude -> chorus

**importance of recitative**: adapting recitative to French language . Note that it's always connected to the language, speech. French is really different from Italian.

*Features of Lully's recitative:*
- scored for solo voice & bass continuo
- alternates freely between bars of 2,3,4 beats
- natural declamation of text; as speechlike as possible:
    - modeled on French actors' declamation
    - some sections: more regular metrical style & active bass




c) **Act II/v: prelude, recitative & aria:** “Enfin il est en ma puissance” [Finally he is in my power]
- prelude: tense, some characteristics of overture
- recitative:
    - shifting meter
    - accompanied only by bass continuo
    - dramatic use of rests
    - m.66: more regular meter recitative
        - end of recitative before aria
- air (aria)
    - introduced by orchestra
	- Aria: accompanied only by basso continuo
	- style & meter: minuet style (triple meter)
	- text-setting: syllabic
	- simpler than contemporary Italian arias

## Opera in England:
At the same time, not too long afterwards, 3 years later, we have the only? English opera in Baroque.

- repeating bass line: heard **11** times
- ➘ G - F♯ -  F♮ -  E♮ -  E♭ -  D - G
- ground bass: string orchestra + basso continuo

* melody: dissonant against bass line.

c) **Chorus (repeats), Cupids: "With drooping wings"**  ➘ ➘ ➘

**Recitative-Aria pairs**: kinetic-static (stop & start)
- very little action on stage: reported in recitative
- 29 arias in *Julius Caesar*: arrival points!
- uses **da capo aria** almost exclusively:
    - “da capo”
        - = Italian for “from the top”
        - = Instructions in score: sing from the beginning again
    - aria form with 2 sections:
        - 1st section (A) repeated after 2nd (B)
        - ABA’ form – A’: singer improvises embellishments. (If they sing exactly same, will be booted off the stage by the audience)

An example: *Alessandro Moreschi, Castrato, Ave Maria*. Old audio... (last surviving castrato)

### Act II, sc. 1-2
What is happening in this scene?
- Cleopatra (disguised as Lidia) puts on a spectacle for Caesar:
    - in costume as “Virtue” on throne surrounded by 9 muses (9 musicians on stage)
    - Caesar is overcome with the beauty (sights & sounds!)

sc. 1: Recitative: “Eseguisti”:
- setting the stage

| sinfonia  | Caesar | A    | B     |  [Caesar interrupts] | A’|
| :----- | :----- | :--- | :---- | :----------------- | :-----|
| instrumental introduction| interrupts| aria | |recitative secco for dramatic effect | aria da capo|

**A**: F major, Largo tempo
- Sarabande rhythm (triple meter)

<p align="center">***PIVOTAL WORK IN OPERA REFORM***</p>

1752-1754 Paris performances of La serva padrona: led to "La querelle des bouffons" (1752-54): war of the comic actors


**furious dispute in France between:**

1. those who favoured Italian opera buffa (comic opera) style:
    - simplicity, clarity, warm Italian melodic style, naturalism
    - simple harmony & accompaniment; frequent repetition
    - Jean-Jacques Rousseau: admired by Gluck as “pioneer of the expressive natural style”
    <br>NAWM 111: Le devin du village, 1752
2. those who favoured French style of Lully, Rameau: (favor exisiting French Opera)
    - labeled "intellectuals", unnatural style, sophisticated


*La Serva padrona*: <br>
**Model of comic opera in later 18C:**
- Contrasts of styles & mixing of serious & comic
- Servants outwitting masters: laugh at Uberto’s expense
