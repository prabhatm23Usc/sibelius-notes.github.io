# Graph Algorithms
## Basic
directed, adjacent, incident, indegree, outdegree, path, cycle, tree, connected, connected component.

A **simple** path does not repeat vertices. A **simple** cycle does not repeat vertices.


Our algorithms will be for abstract graphs. Two ways to represent:
- adjacency matrix: space &#92;(O(n^2) &#92;)
- adjacency lists: space &#92;(O(n+m) &#92;)

|basic operations  | adj matrix| adj lists|
| :------------- | :------------- | :-- |
| list &#92;(v &#92;)'s neighbours| &#92;(\Theta(n) &#92;) | &#92;(\Theta(1+\deg(v)) &#92;)|
| list all edges | &#92;(\Theta(n^2) &#92;) | &#92;(\Theta(n+m) &#92;) |
| is &#92;((u,v)\in E &#92;) | &#92;(\Theta(1) &#92;) | &#92;(\Theta(1+\deg(u)) &#92;) |

where the last complexity &#92;(\Theta(1+\deg(u)) &#92;)  can be reduced to &#92;(O(1) &#92;)
with (sophisiticated) hashing.

For algorithm in this course, we will use adjacency lists.

## Exploring Graphs

### BFS
Cautious search: check everything one edge away, then two...

It takes &#92;(O(n+m) &#92;) time: we explore each vertex once and check all incident edges: &#92;(O(n+\sum_{v\in V} \deg(v))=O(n+m) &#92;). Recall &#92;(\sum_{v\in V} \deg(v) = 2m &#92;).

**Properties**
- The parent pointers create a directed tree.
- &#92;(u &#92;) is connected to &#92;(v_0 &#92;) iff BFS from &#92;(v_0 &#92;) reaches &#92;(u &#92;).
- The level of a vertex &#92;(v &#92;) = length of shortest path from &#92;(v_0 &#92;) to &#92;(v &#92;).

**Consequences**
1. BFS from &#92;(v_0 &#92;) finds the connected component of &#92;(v_0 &#92;)
2. BFS finds shortest paths (# edges) from &#92;(v_0 &#92;)

**BFS to test bipartiteness**
definition omitted... it cannot have an odd cycle.

### DFS
Bold search: go as far as you can; when there's nothing new to discover, retrace your steps to find sth new.

Note: orders depend on order in adjacency list. Use a stack to store vertices that have been discovered but must still be explored. So we use a recursive algorithm where stack is implicit.

Runtime: &#92;(O(n+m) &#92;)

All non-tree edges join ancestor and descendant.

Here we abbr: &#92;(d(v)=discovers(v), f(v)=finish(v) &#92;). If &#92;(d(v)<d(u) &#92;) then we have only two possiblities: either nested or disjoint
```
[       ]       [       ]           OR      [        [       ]       ]
d(v)    f(v)    d(u)    f(u)                d(v)     d(u)    f(u)    f(v)
```
because interval &#92;(d(v),f(v) &#92;) is time on stack.

**DFS to find 2-connected components**. Involve some defns of cut-vertex. Not covered in D.R. Stinson's slide.
- **Claim**: The root is a cut vertex iff it has &#92;(> 1&#92;) child.
- **Lemma**: non-root &#92;(v &#92;) is a cut vertex iff &#92;(v &#92;) has a subtree &#92;(T &#92;) with non-tree edge going to an ancestor of &#92;(v &#92;).

Now let's DFS on **Directed Graphs**.
- **tree edges** form a forest of trees.
- **forward edges** are from a vertex to a descendant in the tree.
- **cross edges** are from node a to node b where the subtrees rooted at a and b are disjoint.
- **back edges** are from a vertex to an ancestor.

Then in DFS, we label the edges:
- if u not finished, then (v, u) is back edge
- else if &#92;(d(u) > d(v)&#92;) then (v, u) forward edge
- else if &#92;(d(u) < d(v) &#92;) then (v, u) cross edge

**Applications of DFS**
1. detecting cycles in directed graphs.<br>
**Lemma**: A directed graph has a directed cycle iff DFS has a back edge.
2. Topological sort of a directed **acyclic** (no directed cycle) graph. Edge &#92;((a,b) &#92;) means &#92;(a &#92;) must come before &#92;(b &#92;). (e.g. job scheduling). Find a linear order of vertices satisfying all edges. (possible if no directed cycle).
<br>**One solution**: find vertex &#92;(v &#92;) with no in-edge. Remove &#92;(v &#92;) and repeat. &#92;(O(n+m) &#92;)
<br>**Solution using DFS**: also &#92;(O(n+m) &#92;) use reverse of finish order.
3. Finding strongly connected components in a directed graph.
<br> Strongly connected = for all vertices &#92;(u,v &#92;) there is a path &#92;(u\to v &#92;) and a path &#92;(v\to u &#92;).
<br> **Claim**  Let &#92;(s &#92;) be a vertex. (G &#92;) is strongly connected if for all vertices &#92;(v &#92;) there is a path &#92;(s\to v &#92;) and a path &#92;(v\to s &#92;).
<br>To test if there's a path &#92;(s\to v\quad \forall v &#92;), do DFS(s). How can we test it there's a path &#92;(v\to s\quad \forall v &#92;)? Reverse edge directions and do DFS(s). **Neat!**.

More generally, a digraph can be partitioned to strongly connected components.

Contracting strongly connected components gives acyclic graph.

*How to find strongly connected components?*

Idea: vertices 1 ... n.
<br>Run DFS (vertex ordering resolves what vertex comes next).
<br> Let finish order be &#92;(f_1 f_2 \ldots f_2 &#92;).
<br>&#92;(G^R=G &#92;) with all edges reversed.
<br>run DFS &#92;(G^R &#92;) with vertex order &#92;(f_n f_{n-1}\ldots f_1 &#92;)

Trees in 2nd DFS are exactly the strongly connected components.

**Shairi's Algorithm to Find the Strongly Connected Components**
1. Perform a depth-first search of G, recording the finishing times *f[v]* for all vertices v.
2. Construct a directed graph H from G by **reversing** the direction of all edges in G.
3. Perform a depth-first search of H, considering the vertices in **decreasing** order of the values *f[v]* computed in step 1.
4. The strongly connected components of G are the trees in the depth-first forest constructed in step 3.

## Minimum Spanning Tree
Given a graph &#92;(G=(V,E) &#92;) with weights &#92;(\omega:E\to \mathbb R^{\ge 0} &#92;) one the edges find a subset of the edges that connected all the vertices and has minimum weight. The edge subset will be a tree, called the **minimum spanning tree**.

Greedy alg will find min spanning trees with different implementation challenges.
- add cheapest edge first, never build a cycle: Kruskal's alg.
- grow connected graph from one vertex: Prim's alg.

### Kruskal's Algorithm
```
Order edges by weight
    w(e_i) <= w(e_{i+1})
T <- ∅
for i = 1..m
    if e_i does not make a cycle with T then
        T <- T ∪ {e_i}
endfor
```
 &#92;(O(m\log m) = O(m\log n) &#92;) to sort edges because &#92;(m\le n^2 &#92;). Then we need to  maintain connected components as we add edges. So it is union-find problem.

#### Union-Find Problem
Maintain a collection of disjoint sets.

Operations:
- `Find(x)` - which set contains element x?
- `Union` - unite two sets.

Every tree contains a leader vertex. We construct an auxiliary array &#92;(L &#92;). From &#92;(v &#92;), follow a directed path &#92;(v\to L[v]\to L[L[v]] \to \ldots &#92;) until we reach &#92;(w &#92;) with &#92;(L[w]=w &#92;). Then &#92;(w=find(v) &#92;).

> Or keep array `S[1..n]`, `S[i]` = component  of element i and keep linked list in each set.

Then `find` is &#92;(O(1) &#92;). Union: must joint 2 linked lists &#92;(O(1) &#92;) and rename one of the two sets. So &#92;(O(n) &#92;) in worst case. BUT renaming smaller set does better! If an element's set number changes, then its set (more than) doubles. This happens &#92;(\le  \log n&#92;)  times. Therefore total renaming work is &#92;(On\log n &#92;). Thus total runtime
&#92;[
    \underbrace{O(m\log n)}_{sort} +
    \underbrace{O(m)}_{finds} +
    \underbrace{O(n\log n)}_{unions}
    = O(m\log n)
&#92;]
Assuming &#92;(G &#92;) is connected, so &#92;(m\ge n-1 &#92;).

### Prim's Algorithm
```
initialize C <- {S}, T <- ∅
while C != V
    find min weight edge e = (u, v) from u ∈ C to v ∈ V \ C
    T <- T ∪ {e}
    C <- C ∪ {v}
end
```


Implementation: We use priority queue as data structure (using min-heap, and we know each operation takes &#92;(O(\log k) &#92;) where &#92;(k &#92;) is # of elements), maitain a set of weighted elements.
- Find and delete min weight element
- insert
- delete

Total cost
&#92;[
    O(n\log m + m\log m+ m\log m)  = O(m\log m) = O(m\log n)
&#92;]
