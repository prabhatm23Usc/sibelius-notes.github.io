# Lecture 1
## Part A: Welcome To The Show!
This course is about music and movies and what happened when they put together.

Textbook is like Google Earth view. Listening to lectures is like Google street view.
 
And Iâ€™ll see you again in Part B.  

## Part B: Our First Scene
This is the music written specifically for the scene. The film has already been chopped and the composer was writing music while watching the film on fold. The composer has synchronized the music they have written to what goes on within the scene. Watch the scene with the sound off.
