# Week 3

## homophony with PM

Elaborate chord, could do PM.

If soprano 7-8, 2-1, 4-3, we can do deceptive resolution. 2-3 doesn't work cause it creates parallel fifth. With decoration, 2-4-3 in soprano avoids parallel fifth.

Minor prolongation including Neapolitan flat 6 on weak beat.

Subdominant prolongation (in primary tonic), PM.

PM in cadence. Before that, IV or II chord, can do PM.

After this, do a Plagal Cadence.

### Steps

- Step 1: Analyze a soprano, choose harmonic path and consider PM
- Step 2: Compose a decorated bass.
  - soprano 1 2 3, bass 3 2 1
