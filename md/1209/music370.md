# Week 2
Review on chapter 22 and 6,4 chords.

# Week 3
## Chapter 23
Primary mixture on major keys/ minor keys.

Tonicization represent the broadest application of chromatics in major-minor tonality. But chromaticism need not always serve the interests of tonicization: we can intensify the harmonic events in a major-key or minor-key by introducing chords borrowed from the parallel mode. This process is called **primary mixture**.

### PM in Major
lowering <span>&#92;(\hat 6 &#92;)</span> (and <span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span>)

Pre-dominant chords, mixture in tonic prolongation, plagal cadence

### PM in minor
Picardy third: raise <span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span> in the cadential I

When the Phrygian and minor modes are notated on the same tonic, their tonic patterns differ only in respect to the placement of their second degrees. **Phrygian II chord** can be introduced in a minor key by lowering <span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span>. The Phrygian II appears most often as a sixth chord in minor, where it is commonly called a **Neapolitan 6th**. We frequently meet the Neapolitan 6th as a pre-dominant chord.
## homophony with PM

Elaborate chord, could do PM.

If soprano 7-8, 2-1, 4-3, we can do deceptive resolution. 2-3 doesn't work cause it creates parallel fifth. With decoration, 2-4-3 in soprano avoids parallel fifth.

Minor prolongation including Neapolitan flat 6 on weak beat.

Subdominant prolongation (in primary tonic), PM.

PM in cadence. Before that, IV or II chord, can do PM.

After this, do a Plagal Cadence.

### Steps

- Step 1: Analyze a soprano, choose harmonic path and consider PM
- Step 2: Compose a decorated bass.
  - soprano 1 2 3, bass 3 2 1
- Step 3: Elaborate the soprano
- Step 4: Add Inner Voices
  - not half diminished in minor key, only fully diminished
- Step 5: decorated plagal cadence

If do a minor homophony, for chapter 23. Don't apply plagal cadence in minor. It doesn't help. End in major.

Soprano: Once you hit the final tonic with ties, just stay on that.

# Week 4
## The Augmented 6th chords
Not tonicize, but intensify this motion to the dominant.

soprano: 8 7 8. bass: b6 5 1. Then introduce third voice, #4, which is A4 above the bass. Then fourth voice:
- double the third: Italian <span>&#92;(^6_3 &#92;)</span>
- enters on <span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span>, French <span>&#92;(^4_3 &#92;)</span>
- perfect fifth above the bass (<span>&#92;(\hat 3 &#92;)</span> in minor, <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 3 &#92;)</span> in major), German <span>&#92;(^6_5 &#92;)</span>. Note the unavoidable parallel fifth as 3<span>&#92;(\to &#92;)</span>2.

## More on A6
It has always to resolve to dominant, but doesn't always have to be on the strong beat.

These are embellishing chords, not pre-dominant, not elaborate.

Interpolated <span>&#92;(C _ 4 ^ 6 &#92;)</span>:
- Major: <span>&#92;(\flat 3\to \natural 3 \to 2 \to 1 \text{ or } 3 &#92;)</span>
- Minor: no change on 3 since 3 has been flatted

Ex 24.18 The enharmonic German <span>&#92;(^6_5 &#92;)</span>, only in major.

Ex 24.27 Noncadential A6

## Common-Tone Diminished 7th
another embellishing chord.

only works in major key.

Ex 24.29: CT is creating chromatism to chordal 3rd (<span>&#92;(\hat 7 &#92;)</span>), chordal 5th (<span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span>): <span>&#92;(\sharp \hat 6\to \hat 7, \sharp \hat 1 \to \hat 2 &#92;)</span>.

In summary for CT<span>&#92;(^\circ &#92;)</span>7 voice leading is:
- <span>&#92;(\sharp 6 \to 7 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\sharp 1 \to 2 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(5\to 5 &#92;)</span> (the common tone!)
- <span>&#92;(3\to 2 &#92;)</span> for V and V<sup>6</sup> or <span>&#92;(3\to 4 &#92;)</span> for V<sup>7</sup> and all inversions

## T3A-05
Step 1: correct homophony from chapter 19.

Step 2: Where can new chords go? PM, A6, CT<sup>o</sup>7 (remember this has to be in Major)

Step 3: Remove some decoration, and allow for a slight reworking places where PM, Aug 6 and CT<sup>o</sup>7 can work

Step 4: Get the framework set-up again, with new harmonization altering what is needed to allow for PM as well. Insert CT<sup>o</sup>

Step 5: Fill in the inner voices, and make sure the voice leading works and is pleasing! 

# Week 5
Chapter 25: Intensifying the Tonic 
## The Augmented Dominant 
Only available in major. Better to use on a weak beat, cause might create A2 in the voice leading. <span>&#92;(\hat 2 \to \sharp \hat 2 \to \hat 3 &#92;)</span>. Can have a triad, or have augmented dominant 7th.

## The Diminished Dominant 4-3
Can be used in both major or minor. Start with V<sup>7</sup> chord in second inversion, and find <span>&#92;(\hat 2 &#92;)</span> in bass, then <span>&#92;(\hat 2 \to \flat \hat 2 \to \hat 1 &#92;)</span>. Best done in weak beat.

Example 25.26, could on strong beat. In minor, <span>&#92;(\flat \hat 3\to \flat \hat 2 \to \hat 1 &#92;)</span>.

## CTdim7 to I, I6 and C6/4
- <span>&#92;(\hat 5 \to \sharp \hat 4 \to \hat 5 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\hat 5 \to \hat 6 \to \hat 5 &#92;)</span> or <span>&#92;(\hat 3 \to \hat 6 \to \hat 5 &#92;)</span> or <span>&#92;(\hat 1\to \hat 6\to \hat 5 &#92;)</span>
- <span>&#92;(\hat 3\to \hat \sharp \hat 2\to \hat 3 &#92;)</span>
