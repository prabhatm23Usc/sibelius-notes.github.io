# Lecture 1
## Part A
some introduction. Welcome to the first lecture for music 140, spring 2020, pandemic version.
You probably notice that these audio files are monophonic. That's deliberate because monophonic files are half of the size of the equivalent stereophonic files. We'll get to them eventually.

## Part B: The World of 1945
Why there is a music industry? In quite oversimplified terms:
We are going to talk about why the industry looks the way it does. Starting point: end of world war 2. We are going to pick 1945.

Famous people are not always important people. Our example: a young lady, Diane Warren. She is one of the successful songwriters: 12 Grammy Nominations,
11 Academy Award Nominations,
Songs used in over 60 films,
Over 100 songs on “Billboard Top 100” songs including 32,
Top-Ten and 9 No. 1s. And yet chances are very good, many have never heard of her.

We are going to pick 1945. Popular music has different styles. What would be dominant in 1945? Music of "Big band". Music designed for dancing. Vocalists somewhat dominate the popular music since 1950s. Vocalists do not always rule the popular music. It's isolated back and forth. Let's turn to an example of "Big Band". We are going to listen to "Sentimental Journey".

Saxophones, main melody rhythm section. Then it comes with trumpets, and trombones. Smooth rhythm. We have three names: Brown/Homer/Green. They are songwriters. This music is performed by Les Brown and His Band of Renown, featuring Doris Day. It was primarily instrumental, but vocalist was a featuring part of the group. The main focus was instrumental, and vocalist would come in as a change of timbre.

In 1945, Big Band is the top of the pile. Band leaders such as Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey where the “stars” of this period. Even though many have vocalists, they were seen as part of the band, not the focus. That's gonna change when moving to 1950s.

In 1945, in broad terms, music industry divided into three distinct categories:
1. Popular (or pop): intended audience - white / middle class / urban / northern US
2. Race: intended audience - black, regardless of class or location
3. Hillbilly: intended audience
    - lower/working class, primarily white / southern US
    - origins in poor, white, rural
    - is now migrating to urban areas (particularly in the southern US)

They are much more about business, demographics, audiences. It was categorized not by who played the music, but the target audience.

We have heard a little pop. What did the other two sound like? Let's start with race.  For a race example, "Good Rockin' Tonight". Performed by Wynonie Harris rr(Roy Brown, 1947)
- This version by Wynonie Harris (Recorded in 1948)
- General category - Race Music (intended audience is black, African American)
- Specific category – Jump Blues

Unlike big band music, this focuses on vocal, though have overlapped with instruments in big band, it has much smaller group than big bands. Like the big band example, we have the change of texture. But here, with the focus on vocal, the change of texture is now the saxophone solo.

Now let's listen to a little bit of Hillbilly music: “Blue Moon of Kentucky” (Bill Monroe, 1946 – Recording released in 1947). We've no longer got instrumental band. We gotta focus on acoustic guitar and so on. Quite a different approach to a production of voice. General category – Hillbilly; Specific category – Bluegrass.

First example, Doris Day: voice smooth, carefully pronounced lyrics. Harris: rich sound, distortion in voice. Bill: quite common, emotional distance; he is singing like he is observing sth even the song is first person; recite lyrics. Choices are made to carry the meaning and value to intended audience.

What does music industry selling?
- Products of the music industry are sheet music and recordings.
- Sheet music dominates recordings until the late 1920s.
- While sheet music is still important, by the end of WWII the Recording Industry has come to dominate.

So what does the world look like in 1945? If that's the world look like in 1945 in very simple terms, why? For that, I'll see you in part C.

## Part C: How do you make a music industry?
What is a music industry? An industry where people make money by selling music. Fundamental question: what is music? What are you actually paying for? Very simply put: music is an idea, music is a thought.  What creates the conditions for Popular Music to become a consumer product? - copyright law - intellectual property. In 1770s, the US becomes a country, then set up all laws and constitutions. Between 1790s to 1830s, copyright law reforms: Amendments to the copyright law to cover sheet music. By the early 1800, more composers tried to make a living not by selling music to kings/queens, but selling to general public. Then music industry started to take shape. To talk about how these all worked, let's listen to a style of music called the **Victorian Ballad**. In general, it is a style of song that becomes very popular during 1800s.

Where does the audience comes from? We need to mention Industrial Revolution. At the beginning, most people lived in rural. And they looked after everything by themselves. Make everything they need. But as we moved into IR, we see the rise of factories. More people coming out of the country, move to the city. Most of the time, can just earn the money to survive, but you can start to save the money, then gain wealth. At the beginning of IR, the top people (Kings) have most of the money; at the bottom, peasants have nothing. But as IR took hold, we see sth new. We have rise of middle class: not have much money compared to top, but have more than they need. Then can spend on luxury items. Best example: Piano.

**Parlour Songs** is a subcategory of the Victorian Ballad: Daughters pursue “leisure” activities. Let's consider an example:  Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms Thomas Moore (early 1800s).
> (A) Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,
Which I gaze on so fondly to-day<br>
(A) Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms, Like fairy-gifts fading away,<br>
(B) Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art, Let thy loveliness fade as it will, <br>
(A) And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart Would entwine itself verdantly still.

Lovely piece. This creates an appropriate appearance of middle class. (Daughters sing/play). Characteristics:
- Piano Accompaniment. Primary instrument of the style.
- Vocal control, Timbre
- Themes: loyalty, honesty, control, restraint

These songs carried the social values of that time. Not only the lyrics, but the way they actually performed.
In more general terms, the popularity of this music, the fact that government is paying attention to crafting copyright laws tell us the market, middle class are growing. The popular music industry is starting to take shape because it now has an audience. But do we have what we would recognize as music industry today? We are getting there, but we are lacking one fundamental thing which comes along 1892. For that, I'll see you in part D.

## Part D:  Tin Pan Alley
Late 1800, music industry taking shape, songwriters make living by selling **sheet music** to this growing audience of middle class. At that time, recordings DNE. People like Stephen Collins Foster, they did very well, but they didn't become extremely wealthy. That's because sth is still missing. It came along in 1892. Charles K Harris, “After the Ball” 1892.

*music playing*

After listening to that song, you might wonder, is that still Parlour song? since there are other instruments. Yes that was. If you heard it perform in someone's home, then voice + piano. Sheet music sells over 5,000,000 copies. The first "Hit Song". Why "After the Ball"? It's hard to answer. It's a tale like Parlour music. This is possibly the wrong question. Right question: why 1892? Let's look at a chart: Rural to Urban Population Shift in the United States (1790-1900). People moved from rural to urban from 1790 to 1900. Important takeaway: you can't have a hit if your audience are all living in a country. Because in a country, people are spread too far apart. Then why 1982? because there were enough people concentrated in urban areas for this kind of phenomenon to take place. Demand for newly composed songs leads to the increased organization of the music industry - Success
of “After the Ball” gives birth to Tin Pan Alley (TPA), center of the music industry based in New York City.
Both a musical style and a place:
- Manhattan in New York City
- becomes the center of professional music making
- During ‘20s and ‘30s 21,000 publishers, 36,000 composers
- division of labour: composer, lyricists, publisher, publicity, performers. Unlike rural area, you do everything yourself.
- Sheet music dominates – (transition to recordings begins during the 1920s)

TPA is not just a place. It's a musical style, develops a specific way of writing songs. In terms of lyrics: idealized romance – beginning and ending.  Music:
- easy to play
- easy to sing – phrasing and range
- AABA musical form

Let's take a look at “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” (Arlen/Harburg, 1939), which is a great example of AABA.


# Lecture 2
Now it is with race that we are going to be concerned primarily this week, because we are going to look at is how the music of African Americans make it to North America, how it survive nightmare of slavery. To start with, the history of slavery.

## Part A: Slavery
If you are looking for a date of the birth of popular music In North America, a good candidate would be 1619: beginning of one of the darkest chapters in this history of western culture. 1619: first time ever, slaves kidnapped from their homes (West Africa) were sold into bandage on continental North America. This event has profound effect on history. Slavery lasted about 250 yrs. They are no longer considered human. They were themselves personal possessions. And yet, they managed to bring with them some sense of their culture/storytelling/music. And it is that west African origin that would become the core of structuring the sound of African American music culture. Let's listen to an example: “Old Alabama” 1947.

*Music playing*
![there should be a image...](/pics/slave.jpg)


First question: is the recording actually by slaves? No, cause recording tech didn't appear until late 1800. Slavery ended in 1865, so it's impossible to these two to line up. The recording is about a prison gang such as a picture above. 7 am in the morning, a group of African American chopping a large tree that has fallen after a storm. The knocking sound is the swinging of the axes.
Even though we don't have a audio recording of that period, we have lots of written accounts of what people heard. From these written accounts, these recordings are a great depiction of what might actually be going on.

This is called **work song**. One of many different types that existed among African Americans during slavery. In fact, work song is quite important. It can pass time/set pace. And singing to coordinate work was seen as a good strategy. It's more complicated in the recording: they are not simply singing a song, the song is improvised in the moment. Singing the same song over and over again is boring...

The first voice you heard is song leaders. They are valuable as far as slaves are concerned. Take Lego bricks as an example. A brick typically has two lyrical lines. The value of song leaders is that they are able to think on their feet and put these Lego bricks together to create interesting songs everyday.

We are not yet dealing with professional song writing/singing. They don't do these for a living. These songs are improvised, and put together by some preexisting beats and pieces, which don't belong to anyone. Any song leader can use them, can sing them. Musicologist describes this kind of phenomenon as *Floating pool of verse*: something doesn't legally belong to anyone but really the property of the community, anyone who wants to can make use of it.

What we are listening to at this point we would describe as **folk music**. There are some fundamental differences between folk and professional.
- performed by amateurs: not for a living.
- more concern with tradition than innovation (lacking “self-consciousness”)

In the context of the course, “Self-Consciousness” will refer to a musician who is actively looking for ways to innovate in terms of performance and/or composition. It is often a sign of professionalization as professional musicians are always looking for ways to ‘stand out’ from others.

We have to be careful, not all folk musicians are amateurs. As we see later in the course, folk music will actually become an important element within music industry itself with the work such as Bob Dylan. The other important term: **African Retentions**. Relatively speaking, keep in mind that we are talking about a fairly specific region of the West Africa Coast. So what are African Retentions? In this case, fundamental aspects of the way people make music.

Literally, we are not saying the music sounds like music of culture of West Africa. At surface level, music fundamentally changes, since slave owners often suppress West African Culturing in order to make slaves' lives as miserable as possible. However, we can still trace some elements back to West Africa in terms of their origins.

For example, *interest in percussive and distorted timbres*. Percussive: sound created by striking the instruments, short and quick articulations. Distortion: from West African culture perspective, it can imply an excess or overload of energy and emotions.

Next thing, the use of *riffs*: A small self-contained piece of music that repeats over and over again becoming the basis for longer composition. For those who have classical music background might be wondering what's the difference between riff-based composition and a motif based composition. One great example of motif based in western classical music is Beethoven's fifth Symphony. So is that riff? No, because Beethoven is constantly varying the motif.

The last thing: the use of *call and response*.

## Part B: The Blues
A simplified history of slavery and civil war, from posted notes:
> In the US, slavery ends in 1865 at the conclusion of the US Civil War (1861-1865). By the mid 1800s slavery had been outlawed in most ‘northern’ states but had become central to the economy of the south. There were numerous issues between north and south and the end of slavery became a central point. The north wished to abolish it, the south did not.<br><br>
The war was brutal and is considered by many military historians to be the most devastating conflict ever fought by humans until the World Wars of the 20th century.


Post Slavery: (1865 - )
-	Institutionalized Racism. Laws made it difficult to be black. For example, if you are an African American, when you are approaching a white woman, you need to take off your hat and bow. Otherwise, you could go to jail. Things are quite fraud.
-	Acceleration of Rural-to-Urban shift.
-	New forms of music appear during late 1800s.
-	Ragtime and Jazz – urban styles, incorporated into popular music

But what we are going to look at is what's going on the rural areas: Country (Rural) Blues. Typically it is performed by single individual, no bands at this point.
- Wandering musician.
- Male vocalist, with Acoustic Guitar.
- Plaintive vocal sound – lament.
- Themes include: Travel, Economics, and Love.

Recall AABA in pop songs, it simply refers to melody. There's nothing about what the words have to do and how long the sections need to be. Also, there's no specification about the accompaniments: chords/base notes and so on. All that are left open.
Blues, unlike AABAs, specifies things to a very high degree. For example, blues is a  specific length. Each blue structure within a blue song is generally what we called *12 measure phrases*. The terms "bar" and "measure" are interchangeable. If you are hanging around with classically trained musicians, you are more likely to hear the term measures. Otherwise, commercial/popular musicians, then bars. Even then, that's not a hard rule.

The next thing that blues specifies is how many lines of lyrics each subsection have: the number is three. *a-a-b lyric pattern*. Here we are using lower case letters for words.
