# Lecture 1
## Part A
some introduction. Welcome to the first lecture for music 140, spring 2020, pandemic version.
You probably notice that these audio files are monophonic. That's deliberate because monophonic files are half of the size of the equivalent stereophonic files. We'll get to them eventually.

## Part B: The World of 1945
Why there is a music industry? In quite oversimplified terms:
We are going to talk about why the industry looks the way it does. Starting point: end of world war 2. We are going to pick 1945.

Famous people are not always important people. Our example: a young lady, Diane Warren. She is one of the successful songwriters: 12 Grammy Nominations,
11 Academy Award Nominations,
Songs used in over 60 films,
Over 100 songs on “Billboard Top 100” songs including 32,
Top-Ten and 9 No. 1s. And yet chances are very good, many have never heard of her.

We are going to pick 1945. Popular music has different styles. What would be dominant in 1945? Music of "Big band". Music designed for dancing. Vocalists somewhat dominate the popular music since 1950s. Vocalists do not always rule the popular music. It's isolated back and forth. Let's turn to an example of "Big Band". We are going to listen to "Sentimental Journey".

Saxophones, main melody rhythm section. Then it comes with trumpets, and trombones. Smooth rhythm. We have three names: Brown/Homer/Green. They are songwriters. This music is performed by Les Brown and His Band of Renown, featuring Doris Day. It was primarily instrumental, but vocalist was a featuring part of the group. The main focus was instrumental, and vocalist would come in as a change of timbre.

In 1945, Big Band is the top of the pile. Band leaders such as Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey where the “stars” of this period. Even though many have vocalists, they were seen as part of the band, not the focus. That's gonna change when moving to 1950s.

In 1945, in broad terms, music industry divided into three distinct categories:
1. Popular (or pop): intended audience - white / middle class / urban / northern US
2. Race: intended audience - black, regardless of class or location
3. Hillbilly: intended audience
    - lower/working class, primarily white / southern US
    - origins in poor, white, rural
    - is now migrating to urban areas (particularly in the southern US)

They are much more about business, demographics, audiences. It was categorized not by who played the music, but the target audience.

We have heard a little pop. What did the other two sound like? Let's start with race.  For a race example, "Good Rockin' Tonight". Performed by Wynonie Harris rr(Roy Brown, 1947)
- This version by Wynonie Harris (Recorded in 1948)
- General category - Race Music (intended audience is black, African American)
- Specific category – Jump Blues

Unlike big band music, this focuses on vocal, though have overlapped with instruments in big band, it has much smaller group than big bands. Like the big band example, we have the change of texture. But here, with the focus on vocal, the change of texture is now the saxophone solo.

Now let's listen to a little bit of Hillbilly music: “Blue Moon of Kentucky” (Bill Monroe, 1946 – Recording released in 1947). We've no longer got instrumental band. We gotta focus on acoustic guitar and so on. Quite a different approach to a production of voice. General category – Hillbilly; Specific category – Bluegrass.

First example, Doris Day: voice smooth, carefully pronounced lyrics. Harris: rich sound, distortion in voice. Bill: quite common, emotional distance; he is singing like he is observing sth even the song is first person; recite lyrics. Choices are made to carry the meaning and value to intended audience.

What does music industry selling?
- Products of the music industry are sheet music and recordings.
- Sheet music dominates recordings until the late 1920s.
- While sheet music is still important, by the end of WWII the Recording Industry has come to dominate.

So what does the world look like in 1945? If that's the world look like in 1945 in very simple terms, why? For that, I'll see you in part C.

## Part C: How do you make a music industry?
What is a music industry? An industry where people make money by selling music. Fundamental question: what is music? What are you actually paying for? Very simply put: music is an idea, music is a thought.  What creates the conditions for Popular Music to become a consumer product? - copyright law - intellectual property. In 1770s, the US becomes a country, then set up all laws and constitutions. Between 1790s to 1830s, copyright law reforms: Amendments to the copyright law to cover sheet music. By the early 1800, more composers tried to make a living not by selling music to kings/queens, but selling to general public. Then music industry started to take shape. To talk about how these all worked, let's listen to a style of music called the **Victorian Ballad**. In general, it is a style of song that becomes very popular during 1800s.

Where does the audience comes from? We need to mention Industrial Revolution. At the beginning, most people lived in rural. And they looked after everything by themselves. Make everything they need. But as we moved into IR, we see the rise of factories. More people coming out of the country, move to the city. Most of the time, can just earn the money to survive, but you can start to save the money, then gain wealth. At the beginning of IR, the top people (Kings) have most of the money; at the bottom, peasants have nothing. But as IR took hold, we see sth new. We have rise of middle class: not have much money compared to top, but have more than they need. Then can spend on luxury items. Best example: Piano.

**Parlour Songs** is a subcategory of the Victorian Ballad: Daughters pursue “leisure” activities. Let's consider an example:  Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms Thomas Moore (early 1800s).
> (A) Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,
Which I gaze on so fondly to-day<br>
(A) Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms, Like fairy-gifts fading away,<br>
(B) Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art, Let thy loveliness fade as it will, <br>
(A) And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart Would entwine itself verdantly still.

Lovely piece. This creates an appropriate appearance of middle class. (Daughters sing/play). Characteristics:
- Piano Accompaniment. Primary instrument of the style.
- Vocal control, Timbre
- Themes: loyalty, honesty, control, restraint

These songs carried the social values of that time. Not only the lyrics, but the way they actually performed.
In more general terms, the popularity of this music, the fact that government is paying attention to crafting copyright laws tell us the market, middle class are growing. The popular music industry is starting to take shape because it now has an audience. But do we have what we would recognize as music industry today? We are getting there, but we are lacking one fundamental thing which comes along 1892. For that, I'll see you in part D.

## Part D:  Tin Pan Alley
Late 1800, music industry taking shape, songwriters make living by selling **sheet music** to this growing audience of middle class. At that time, recordings DNE. People like Stephen Collins Foster, they did very well, but they didn't become extremely wealthy. That's because sth is still missing. It came along in 1892. Charles K Harris, “After the Ball” 1892.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

After listening to that song, you might wonder, is that still Parlour song? since there are other instruments. Yes that was. If you heard it perform in someone's home, then voice + piano. Sheet music sells over 5,000,000 copies. The first "Hit Song". Why "After the Ball"? It's hard to answer. It's a tale like Parlour music. This is possibly the wrong question. Right question: why 1892? Let's look at a chart: Rural to Urban Population Shift in the United States (1790-1900). People moved from rural to urban from 1790 to 1900. Important takeaway: you can't have a hit if your audience are all living in a country. Because in a country, people are spread too far apart. Then why 1982? because there were enough people concentrated in urban areas for this kind of phenomenon to take place. Demand for newly composed songs leads to the increased organization of the music industry - Success
of “After the Ball” gives birth to Tin Pan Alley (TPA), center of the music industry based in New York City.
Both a musical style and a place:
- Manhattan in New York City
- becomes the center of professional music making
- During ‘20s and ‘30s 21,000 publishers, 36,000 composers
- division of labour: composer, lyricists, publisher, publicity, performers. Unlike rural area, you do everything yourself.
- Sheet music dominates – (transition to recordings begins during the 1920s)

TPA is not just a place. It's a musical style, develops a specific way of writing songs. In terms of lyrics: idealized romance – beginning and ending.  Music:
- easy to play
- easy to sing – phrasing and range
- AABA musical form

Let's take a look at “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” (Arlen/Harburg, 1939), which is a great example of AABA.


# Lecture 2
Now it is with race that we are going to be concerned primarily this week, because we are going to look at is how the music of African Americans make it to North America, how it survive nightmare of slavery. To start with, the history of slavery.

## Part A: Slavery
If you are looking for a date of the birth of popular music In North America, a good candidate would be 1619: beginning of one of the darkest chapters in this history of western culture. 1619: first time ever, slaves kidnapped from their homes (West Africa) were sold into bandage on continental North America. This event has profound effect on history. Slavery lasted about 250 yrs. They are no longer considered human. They were themselves personal possessions. And yet, they managed to bring with them some sense of their culture/storytelling/music. And it is that west African origin that would become the core of structuring the sound of African American music culture. Let's listen to an example: “Old Alabama” 1947.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>
![there should be a image...](/pics/slave.jpg)


First question: is the recording actually by slaves? No, cause recording tech didn't appear until late 1800. Slavery ended in 1865, so it's impossible to these two to line up. The recording is about a prison gang such as a picture above. 7 am in the morning, a group of African American chopping a large tree that has fallen after a storm. The knocking sound is the swinging of the axes.
Even though we don't have a audio recording of that period, we have lots of written accounts of what people heard. From these written accounts, these recordings are a great depiction of what might actually be going on.

This is called **work song**. One of many different types that existed among African Americans during slavery. In fact, work song is quite important. It can pass time/set pace. And singing to coordinate work was seen as a good strategy. It's more complicated in the recording: they are not simply singing a song, the song is improvised in the moment. Singing the same song over and over again is boring...

The first voice you heard is song leaders. They are valuable as far as slaves are concerned. Take Lego bricks as an example. A brick typically has two lyrical lines. The value of song leaders is that they are able to think on their feet and put these Lego bricks together to create interesting songs everyday.

We are not yet dealing with professional song writing/singing. They don't do these for a living. These songs are improvised, and put together by some preexisting beats and pieces, which don't belong to anyone. Any song leader can use them, can sing them. Musicologist describes this kind of phenomenon as *Floating pool of verse*: something doesn't legally belong to anyone but really the property of the community, anyone who wants to can make use of it.

What we are listening to at this point we would describe as **folk music**. There are some fundamental differences between folk and professional.
- performed by amateurs: not for a living.
- more concern with tradition than innovation (lacking “self-consciousness”)

In the context of the course, “Self-Consciousness” will refer to a musician who is actively looking for ways to innovate in terms of performance and/or composition. It is often a sign of professionalization as professional musicians are always looking for ways to ‘stand out’ from others.

We have to be careful, not all folk musicians are amateurs. As we see later in the course, folk music will actually become an important element within music industry itself with the work such as Bob Dylan. The other important term: **African Retentions**. Relatively speaking, keep in mind that we are talking about a fairly specific region of the West Africa Coast. So what are African Retentions? In this case, fundamental aspects of the way people make music.

Literally, we are not saying the music sounds like music of culture of West Africa. At surface level, music fundamentally changes, since slave owners often suppress West African Culturing in order to make slaves' lives as miserable as possible. However, we can still trace some elements back to West Africa in terms of their origins.

For example, *interest in percussive and distorted timbres*. Percussive: sound created by striking the instruments, short and quick articulations. Distortion: from West African culture perspective, it can imply an excess or overload of energy and emotions.

Next thing, the use of *riffs*: A small self-contained piece of music that repeats over and over again becoming the basis for longer composition. For those who have classical music background might be wondering what's the difference between riff-based composition and a motif based composition. One great example of motif based in western classical music is Beethoven's fifth Symphony. So is that riff? No, because Beethoven is constantly varying the motif.

The last thing: the use of *call and response*.

## Part B: The Blues
A simplified history of slavery and civil war, from posted notes:
> In the US, slavery ends in 1865 at the conclusion of the US Civil War (1861-1865). By the mid 1800s slavery had been outlawed in most ‘northern’ states but had become central to the economy of the south. There were numerous issues between north and south and the end of slavery became a central point. The north wished to abolish it, the south did not.<br><br>
The war was brutal and is considered by many military historians to be the most devastating conflict ever fought by humans until the World Wars of the 20th century.


Post Slavery: (1865 - )
-	Institutionalized Racism. Laws made it difficult to be black. For example, if you are an African American, when you are approaching a white woman, you need to take off your hat and bow. Otherwise, you could go to jail. Things are quite fraud.
-	Acceleration of Rural-to-Urban shift.
-	New forms of music appear during late 1800s.
-	Ragtime and Jazz – urban styles, incorporated into popular music

But what we are going to look at is what's going on the rural areas: Country (Rural) Blues. Typically it is performed by single individual, no bands at this point.
- Wandering musician.
- Male vocalist, with Acoustic Guitar.
- Plaintive vocal sound – lament.
- Themes include: Travel, Economics, and Love.

Recall AABA in pop songs, it simply refers to melody. There's nothing about what the words have to do and how long the sections need to be. Also, there's no specification about the accompaniments: chords/base notes and so on. All that are left open.
Blues, unlike AABAs, specifies things to a very high degree. For example, blues is a  specific length. Each blue structure within a blue song is generally what we called *12 measure phrases*. The terms "bar" and "measure" are interchangeable. If you are hanging around with classically trained musicians, you are more likely to hear the term measures. Otherwise, commercial/popular musicians, then bars. Even then, that's not a hard rule.

The next thing that blues specifies is how many lines of lyrics each subsection have: the number is three. *a-a-b lyric pattern*. Here we are using lower case letters for words.

Other features:
- call and response between guitar and voice
- early Blues performers made use of “Floating pool of verse”


| :--- | :-- | :-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |
| Bars | 1   | 2   | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| Chords | I |     |    |    | IV |    | I  |    |  V | IV | I  |    |
| Lyrics | a |     |    |    | a |     |    |    |  b |   |   |    |

The blues tells you specifically which chords to use. Now some examples of blues...

This music appears some time in the 1890s. Taking shape in the beginning of 1900s. Nevertheless, first rural blues recordings made during the 1920s. Why? Essentially, it was not recorded because the recording industry is controlled by urban middle class whites. They are interested in recording pop music, and music aimed at middle class white audiences. Frankly, many of them did not think the culture of African Americans was worth recording. First example of country blues: “Travelin’ Blues” Blind Willie McTell (1929).
> Mr. Engineer, let a man ride this line.	<span style="color:red">a</span> <br>
Mr. Engineer, let a poor man ride this line.	<span style="color:red">a</span><br>
I wouldn’t mind it fella’, but you know this train ain’t mine. 	<span style="color:red">b</span>

This is a professional performance, since Blind Willie McTell is make a living by doing this. But in a way of he is a transitional figure, he is lacking self-consciousness: he is not looking for a way to make his performance stand out.

NOTE: each “4” measure section is only 3 and 1/2 measures long.
-	Travel and Economics.
-	Uneven bar counts – Why? Solo musician.
-	Lack of self-consciousness. (in previous paragraph)
-	“Folk” music

By far the most important was a young man: Robert Johnson: (1911 – 1938).
-	Defined standards for blues guitar.
- did only two recording sessions: November 1936 / June 1937.
-	Mythic character.

He really didn't record that much material. In 1938, he died. He was murdered, poisoned. And we don't know who poisoned him.

Let's listen to an example: “Sweet Home Chicago:” Robert Johnson  (November, 1936).

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

Listen to his introduction. He starts off material that clearly derived from what he uses as transitions from each section to new section. Wonderful subtleties.   

These recordings were aimed primarily at African American audiences. This is the beginning of what  we referred to last week as race music: music performed and recorded for black audiences.

# Lecture 3
## Part A: Of Radio And Records
We start in 1877 with the invention of **mechanical reproduction**. In 1877, Thomas Edison invents the phonograph (gramophone), a device that encodes the sound. The cylinder is the core. Patterns are recorded in the cylinder, and sound would come back from the cylinder by pulling the playback arm.

![there should be a image...](/pics/140/cyl.png)

People didn't use this right way to record music. Edison didn't see this machine as for arts, but for business, speeches. The cylinder made up of wax is fragile. In fact, playing them back worn them out. In 1887, transition from cylinder to disks begins. Sheet music industry was still by far away the main part of the recorded music industry. In fact, the first record made of songs were largely made to promote sheet music. In 1910, disks become dominant medium. In early 1910s, disk speed is standardized 78 rpm.

What was recorded?
- sheet music / TPA. Early record industry controlled by the same people who controlled TPA.
- black music / rural southern white music not recorded because:
    - generally, not part of the TPA/sheet music industry
    - cultural chauvinism
    - rural areas – sales? perception: no market, no audience.

**Commercial Radio**: 1920. Broadcasting. The money is generated through advertising. In 1922, the radio became a major force in western culture. In Jan. 1922, 28 Stations was estimated in the air in US. By December 1922, 570 Stations. Clearly there's money to be made. By the end of 1920s, we begin to see large corporation setup that purchase radio stations all across the country. Then they connect them together. This established the radio networks: CBS, NBC, Mutual. First radio network; NBC in 1928. Very few independent radio stations exist since they are now part of the network. Network radio begins to change patterns of consumption from regional to national.

Success of Radio:
- expensive one-time purchase, unlimited content
- why buy records?

Record is still fragile. It seems radio is going to kill record industry. What happened? Join me in Part B for the rise for the record industry.

## Part B.1: The Rise of the Record Industry

The record industry now is in trouble, needs to find new markets. Then they have a revolution. Ralph Peer – Okeh Records. Ralph has a job: A&R (Artists and repertoire). He needs to find artists who can sing (A part), and songs for them to sing (R part).

Ralph set up a recording session to record new song: Crazy Blues (1920). He got a msg right before the session starts: the singer is sick in the night. He has already put a lot of money: hire recording studio, hire a group of musicians and let them rehearse. However, one of the musicians said he knows a girl who sings well. Then the fellow brings this girl. The young lady named Mamie Smith and she was black. Unspoken rule: African Americans didn't record on record. Ralph is very open-minded man. Then Mamie Smith learnt the song and they recorded "Crazy Blues", and it sounded like this.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

What makes this recording so extraordinary is the fact the vocalist is African American woman. She is considered to be the first significant music recording ever done by a black artist. What happened when it was released? The world didn't end. Ralph and record industry learnt some lessons:
1. Much to their surprise, there was a considerable number of northern urban middle class white who would buy record from a black artist.
2. There was actually small but sizable market for records in African American community.

Then we get to 1922, 1923, the popularity of the radio is off the scale. All of a sudden, the record industry is struggling to survive. How to keep recording industry going in the age of radio? Ralph is one of the people who came up with solution. He realizes the record industry, even not directly associated with sheet music companies, but in large they record the music of Tin Pan Alley. He remembered the success of Mamie Smith, then he has a crazy idea: why don't we record music not Tin Pan Alley, but music popular with African Americans and with rural southern whites? because their music are not in radio by large. Perhaps these audiences are big enough to sustain the record industry. So the record industry invented two new categories of recorded music. Rural southern whites: Hillbilly. African Americans: Race.

## Part B.2: “Race” and “Hillbilly”
Hillbilly, example: Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers: “Carve that Possum” (1927). Quite different from Tin Pan Alley, we are listening to rural south, acoustic instruments like acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle. This is the beginning of Hillbilly as recorded genre.

Now also introduced at the same time as a competition for radio was a genre aimed specifically for African American audience, which we know, ultimately becomes race music. A good example: Carr and Blackwell “How Long Blues” (1928). First of all, is this a blues? Technically, it didn't follow the 12 bars pattern, but it is very much blues in terms of its performance. In fact, we can really see it as next step in development of blues. Recall rural to urban shift, more African Americans move to urban centers. This is what happens when rural blues players get to a urban center. What difference can we see?
- two musicians instead of one
- rather than focusing on guitar, we have second instrument, piano, which is clearly the instrument of urban center. Then you can let piano to be the accompaniment part, which frees the guitar player.

We can hear guitar solo. This is actually where the traditional guitar solo begins. We call this style of blues city blues.

If country blues comes first and city blues comes second, why we are listening to city blues recorded at the end of 1920s whereas the country blues we are listening to were made in 1930s? The reason: cultural chauvinism. The same folks, who control Tin Pan Alley, control the recording tech. Then as recording tech started to separate it self from Tin Pan Alley, starts to look for new market, then looks for its neighborhoods. Some first things they found were Carr and Blackwell. Then later for newer artists, they recorded Robert Johnson.

By the end of 1920s and to 1930s, radio and records are existing side by side. Records now starts to overtake sheet music as dominant medium of music industry. Radio is now seen as an opportunity to promote recordings and artists in Tin Pan Alley. Keep in mind: no one is playing records on radio, all radio is performed live. So now we are at the end of world war 2.

As we get to the end of 1940s, a tech comes along that fundamentally changes the world, which creates opportunity for the culture, particularly of African Americans to become highly influential. That tech is **television**.
- First demonstration in 1927
- Experimental and low-resolution broadcasts through the 1930s
- Network broadcasts begin in 1939
- By 1945 – 6 Stations, By 1955 – 411 Stations
- Major Networks move to Television

Like all early radios, early television was performed live, including commercials.

A radio station, WDIA Memphis, 1948. This radio station is owned by some individuals. They were playing TPA records like before, but no one choose them to advertise (which makes the money). So they drove the car around the city of Memphis to find out where their radio station broadcast signal was clearest. They found, much to their amazement, the best reception for WDIA was found in the African American part of the town. So they had a thought. The new owners of WDIA were white. But they went back to the station and made a decision: change the format to all African American culture. So it becomes first "Black Appeal" radio station. Then the advertising dollars starts to come in.
As WDIA success quickly spread, by 1954, 200 BA radio stations are on the air.

## Part C: Rhythm And Blues Is On the Air
To start with, let's consider the years following WWII in US, which we refer it as post-war era. (some history). Now pop music also changes in this new environment. Remember at the end of WWII, Big bands is the most popular. But the end of the war is really the peak of their popularity. They are falling off their popularity during late 1940s. Smaller groups are replacing them, where the focus now is not on band leader, but the vocalists. By the end of the 1940s, smaller groups with focus on singers have become forefront in the popular music industry. Let's look at an example: Most popular song of 1951 - Nat King Cole: “Too Young” (1951, Lippman, Dee).

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

He is a legend, and soft voice, good piano player. Though he is African American, this is not race music, this is pop music. Target market is middle class white urban. The elements in this recording: smooth, round, clear lyrics. Lyrics: idealized romance. Another example: Most popular song of 1953 - Patti Page: “(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window” (1952, Merril).

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

Lovely song. These songs are beautiful. Not designed to get people excited, but to be calm, entertainment. Probably lots of people wanted in the year following WWII. There was something new following the end of the war: huge upswing in the number of children born, baby boomers, massive number in the number of young people.

At the end of 1940s, music industry changed the name: race music <span>&#92;(\Rightarrow &#92;)</span> rhythm and blues. Still cold for African American audiences, but at least it is not so overly racist. Then Hillbilly, which is a bit derogatory, <span>&#92;(\Rightarrow &#92;)</span> country and western.

When we look at the popularity chart through the late 1940s, or early 1950s. We see crossover hits: song generally appears in rhythm and blues chart or country and western chart, then it becomes very popular. And at some point, it will cross over, and appear in the pop chart.

Teenagers then can use transistor radio which is more portable. They were searching for something more exciting, then they found black appeal radio like WDIA. You can listen to all different substyles grouped under R&B. We have already met one of the styles: **Jump Blues**. Good Rockin’ Tonight (1948, Wynonie Harris).

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

Jump blues:
-	Develops from a fusion of Big Band music (TPA/Jazz) with more prominent blues/race music influence.
-	more focus on vocal performer.
-	Smaller group (cheaper) with focus on saxophone, trumpet, and rhythm section (bass, drums, piano).

Why is it called Jump blues? because recall earlier versions we listened to have slow pace, Robert Johnson, Carl Blackwell, but we have same feel as before, but more faster, more energetic, for dancing.

Another style which is popular during that period is known as **Gospel**. First let's listen to a song called *I’ve Got A Woman* (1954) by Ray Charles.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

Ray Charles (Robinson) 1930-2004
-	born, Albany Georgia, south of the US.
-	born with great poverty, blind at age 7
-	learns music in a school for the blind. Though the school is not that fancy, teacher is good enough to recognize his talent: could teach himself to play an instrument extraordinarily quickly. Every music he heard, he could walk over an instrument and play.
-	1952, he signed with Atlantic Records, which was technically independent record (does not have its own distribution network, in comparison to major record company, which can get its record to every store in the country quite easily), but it was still influential, large record label. Which makes it notable is while R&B charts were working on small record labels, and major records mainly deal with pop music.
-	Fusion of the energy of African American spiritual practice with secular lyrics.
-	Success with white audiences – heightened level of intensity

Gospel was not invented by Ray Charles, and it has been a style of music that for a long time. If we go back to a broad view of general African American culture, and we divide the music of African American culture into two equally broad categories: one being secular, one sacred. Divide sacred music in African American culture into two very broad distinctions. Early style: spirituals, later: Gospel. The dividing line is considered to be the American civil war and the end of slavery.

Now what makes this particular mention of Gospel unique is Ray Charles is credited with incorporating elements of Gospel music into pop music, specifically R&B. Gospel is often energetic. He took all of the energy and intensity of church performance and then apply them to the music that is aimed not at spiritual but at secular.

*I’ve Got A Woman* is based on a church song entitled “It Must Be Jesus”. Focus is on the voice, then sax solo for texture change, and then third contrasting texture: usage of stop time. The band is stopping, articulating, emphasizing notes and taking a break. And in that break, Ray Charles is singing a line. Another self-consciousness way of varying texture of the song.

Third style: **Chicago Electric Blues**. An example, Hoochie Coochie Man (1954, Willie Dixon) performed by Muddy Waters. First Muddy Waters, 1913-1983
-	born in Mississippi (south). Grew up in rural area, learnt rural blues.
-	played guitar and harmonica
-	emulated Robert Johnson
-	moves to Chicago, early 1940s
-	After he moved to the city, he found the same thing as everyone since Carl Blackwell has found: cities are louder, you need to make more noise in order to be heard. He then switches to electric guitar, 1945. Wonderful fit  with blues. Amplifier. Guitarists found amplifier could be used to create distortion. As we mentioned earlier, distortion is a desirable characteristics.
-	1946, records for Aristocrat Records (would later become Chess Records)

*Hoochie Coochie Man* (1954, Willie Dixon (composer, bass player))
-	(modified 12-bar blues)
-	Stop Time
-	Prominence of the electric guitar and harmonica

Moral panic: thousands of white parents react negatively to the news that their children increasingly are being influenced by the culture of African Americans. And that is where we will pick up our story next week.

# Lecture 4
## Part A: Cover Versions
Cover Versions: 1954 – 1956, “white” versions of “black” records. Cover versions were quite common at that time. But what makes this unique is the ways of cover versions were changed. Because when you compare then with the original R&B version, the cover version changes the things in a way that was clearly targeted at race. It reduces elements that associated with black culture, and "more appropriate" for middle class white culture. An example: “Tutti Frutti” Little Richard (Richard Wayne Penniman)
- released late 1955 on Specialty Records (lyrics revised by Dorothy LaBostrie)
- “Crossover” hit: \#2 R&B, \#17 Pop

Second version appears in 1956. White artist, Pat Boone. His version of "Tutti Frutti" sounds very different. Most obvious change is the energy and the exuberance of the voice. Little Richard: could not be more excited. Pat Boone: controlled, restrained. Not surprisingly they never came back on R&B chart, but they almost always outsold the original versions on pop chart. Cover version by Pat Boone, \#10 Pop.

One of the first cover versions that fall into the category of race based changes. The song we are going to listen to: "Sh-Boom". The original version: June 1954 by African American group, The Chords, independent record label: Cat Records.

|Intro| A  |Intrld | A  |B  |A  | Intrld |Solo (A) |A  |A out|
|-----|---|------|---|---|---|------|-------|---|----|
|4    |8  |4     |8  |8  |8  |8     |16     |8  |8   |

It soon became a R&B hit, and then crossover hit. Only few weeks after first release in July 1954, a second version was released on major record label: Mercury Records, and group is white vocal group: The Crew Cuts.

|Intro |  A  |A  |B  |A  |Sh-bm (A)|Sh-bm (A)|B  |A  | Intrld |A  |Tag|
|-----|---|---|---|---|--------|--------|---|---|------|---|---|
|4    |8  |8  |8  |8  |8       |8       |8  |8  |7     |8  |6  |

So many changes. Three things:

||The Chords| The Crew Cuts|
|--|--|--|
| Form| 1x through AABA, with interludes | 2xs through AABA – clearly stated|
| Voice| Distorted – use of lower octave in B | Clean, no use of lower octave |
| Solo| Sax – distorted timbre, sexual metaphor | No solo – repeats of “Sh-boom” group <br> vocal – timpani joke.|

- The Chords: \#3 R&B / \#5 Pop
- The Crew Cuts: no R&B / \#1 Pop <br> \#1 for 9 weeks - \#1 song of the year

Racist? Or a continuation of TPA traditions? Probably both. It is racist that these changes are made deliberately to appeal the racist sentiments within a large number of middle class white. But what the major record industry is concerned with was not black and white. It was green, simply a way to make money. Also same things were happening with country and western songs.

By the end of 1946, this practice has been largely abandoned. Why? First, covers are not making much money anymore. Then were they selling them well? In a remarkably short period of time, 1954 to 1946, the listening patterns of millions of primarily middle class white teenagers are going to shift profoundly. Then the record industry realized that they got a new demographic on its hand: Rock 'n' Roll.

## Part B: Rock 'n' Roll
Both White and Black artists performing in this new style: A mix of pop, C&W, and R&B, targeted at teenagers - Rock ‘n’ Roll. The term attributed to Alan Freed. Most of the time, the changes take place in several years. We can look at recordings in 1950s then see that they are starting to show elements that become Rock 'n' Roll.

For example, an early Rock 'n' Roll star, Bill Haley. Born in 1925, and actually  been in music industry for some time. He has been in country and western music industry, and leader of the band “Bill Haley and the Saddlemen”. They were in a substyle of country and western: Western Swing, which has slight faster beat. He is one of the many in early 1950s who noticed the change: growing popularity of R&B among middle class white teenagers. He is one of the first who starts to experiment this new style. He changes the name of band to “Bill Haley and the Comets in 1952”. Some early hits with “Crazy Man, Crazy” and “Shake, Rattle and Roll.” These are not written by him, but cover versions. These cover versions are not race-based cover version, but came out several years after the original hit. He was taking songs that have R&B hits and reworking them in this new splendid style gaining popularity. These songs actually did quite well, particularly on R&B chart, but where he really hit a stride is in 1954, he recorded the song that he will, I think, be best remembered: Rock Around The Clock.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

Follows 12 bar blues pattern. For a white vocalist, we have more distorted sound, and guitar upfront, energetic tempo. Then becomes popular in 1955 because it was used in a film "[Blackboard Jungle](https://youtu.be/Amyo9HNLSgI)". Recall we talked about moral panic earlier, and the film is targeted at that fear.

However, Bill Haley's career is over almost as soon as it begins. He continues  on for many years but "Rock Around The Clock" is really the peak of the career. Why? Recall he was born in 1925, so he is 30 years old when it becomes a hit. For the first time, music industry noticed that teenagers cared about the age of artists. Teenagers are much more interested in listening to music performed by people who appeared to be at least similar in age to themselves. A whole generation of younger musicians start to make a market. Arguably most successful, most famous, he is Elvis Presley.

He was born in 1935, born in Tupelo, Mississippi, which is not too far from Memphis. And indeed, when black appeal radio goes on the air in 1948, he is about 12 years old. Just as he finished high school, he goes by a small local independent record company, Sun Records. Myths: Sam Phillips, producer of Sun Records said to his assistant, Marion Keisker:
> If I could find a white man with the singing voice of black man, I could make millions of dollars.

Then he discovered Elvis Presley. Two problems with myths. First of all, there's nothing to do with biology in terms of how you sound. The way people develop their sound is entirely social. And there's one other problem, Sam claimed that he didn't said it.

![there should be a image...](/pics/140/elvis.jpg)

Then in Spring 1954, starts recording with Scotty Moore (Guitar) and Bill Black (Bass). They first thought he will probably record country and western since he is white and recording in Memphis. And he does not write songs and he is a wonderful song stylists. However, these are not working all that well. Then they take a break. Then during that break, he picks up the guitar and starts playing a R&B song: “That’s Alright Mamma”. Sam hears and thinks he could do it.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

This song is quite like R&B to the audience. So he was interviewed by [Dewey Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Phillips) and got Presley to reveal his race in an interview by asking which high school the 19-year-old singer attended (knowing that, because of segregation, his audience would readily know what race attended which schools) (from wiki).

# Lecture 5
## Part A: Elvis Presley
But record has two sides: A side, B side. They go straight back to studio, then start to work with the second song: “Blue Moon of Kentucky”. Originally country western, Bill Monroe, 1946 – Recording released in 1947. Scotty, Bill, Sam Phillips are going to work “Blue Moon of Kentucky” the way they worked that with 1954 “That’s Alright Mamma”. And try to shape it to something new: Rock 'n' Roll. First, they have a early version, not final version, only go once AABA, and you can hear Sam Phillips come into the room and talk to the band.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

There was Sam coming in the end: That's a pop song, now, little guy. In country and western, most songs follow a subgrouping of 4. Quite unusual in country and western of subgrouping of 3. Bill Monroe's version follows a subgrouping of 3. Early version of Elvis is a subgrouping of 4. Then they finally record the version that is released as part of Elvis' first record. This is what sounded like.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

The difference is quite remarkable. Bass is quieter, and in two-beat. When Scotty starts to play guitar solo, he starts to play walking bass line. Now they shift to sth more energetic, and we hear Bill Black playing *slap bass*: pull the string and let them slap back into the instrument, so they bounce off the fingerboard of the bass. If we listen to Elvis, he is adding extra syllables to create rhythm, percussive timbre.

1954 – 1955: Elvis on Sun. 6 records, 6 singles which have 12 songs – all covers.

Rockabilly – “The Hillbilly Cat.” These two terms (referring to him) are playing this idea that Elvis is doing something new, blending all other elements: R&B, pop, country and western.

Still regional Star, some national success on Country Charts. Then becomes a major star, where independent record label like Sun can't support a major star.

Another person, Colonel Tom Parker, promoter, manager. Early 1956, he takes over the management of Elvis' career. He helps Sam Phillips negotiate the contract transfer to a major record label, RCA. His job is to make him as financially successful as possible and he did a good job. He still needs to get attention for Elvis. How in 1956? 11 appearances on national television.

- Heartbreak Hotel April-May ‘56  \#1 on Pop and Country \#5 on R&B
- August to December ’56 – Hound Dog, Don’t Be Cruel, Love Me Tender all \#1 Pop.
- Hound Dog and Don’t Be Cruel both chart \#1 on pop/country/R&B
- June, 1956: Elvis performs ‘Hound Dog’ on ‘[Texaco Star Theatre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJnVQDA9rHA).’
- Two weeks later, Elvis performs ‘Hound Dog’ on ‘[The Steve Allen Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3r5AiBJr2M).’
-	Parker directs Elvis’ career more towards Pop
-	Elvis not charting R&B after 1957.
- Elvis enters the army – March 1958 to March 1960
- March 1961 - Last public performance for seven years
- within a year, Elvis stops playing live, stops performing as a vocalist, turns his career to movies. Quite bad actor, bad films. All of which would have opportunities for Elvis to sing songs, then go to album to support the film. Songs are safe, not exciting. But he missed live, singing.
- The ’68 Comeback Special. Most of it was terrible, but there was a period in the show for several minutes where Elvis appears in a black leather suit. He sits down with a bunch of musicians including Scotty (guitar player), old drummer. Sadly, Bill Black (bass player) had died during early 1960s. They played many of his songs from 1950s. Elvis performs ‘[That’s Alright Mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZe_8u-rGWE)’ as part of the ’68-Comeback Special’. This is the only time in the whole show that he looks like he is having fun.
- 1970 – 77 Las Vegas
- Elvis dies August 16th, 1977, age 42

## Part B: Chuck Berry
![there should be a image...](/pics/140/chuck.jpg)

picture from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry#/media/File:Chuck_Berry_1957.jpg).

Elvis was a guitar owner, however, Chuck Berry is a guitar player.

He is in some ways the exact opposite of Elvis. Go back to myth: Elvis was a white man singing like a black man. Chuck Berry is the black man who sings like a white man. And in Chuck Berry's case, it was absolutely deliberate. He was born in St. Louis, middle of the continent.  He is also born in middle class. He has one dream: to be rich, not a rock star, not guitarist. He figures out the best way for young African American to make a lot of money is to become a music star in the world of pop music (to appeal middle class white). After some analysis of some music, he comes up with several key ideas. One of them being words and stories.

Chuck enters many of music competitions. R&B is popular in African American competitions. Chuck deliberately takes a different approach: his guitar is brighter, he would sing with more nasal sound, which is more like country and western. As a result, he stood out. He starts to get attention from independent record labels, but unfortunately nothing comes with him initially.

When things get to interesting for Chuck is 1955. He goes to Chicago and starts recording at Chess Records. Chess brothers expect him to do R&B in the style of Muddy Waters. The story is similar to Elvis. First R&B, then take a break. During the break, Chuck starts playing a country and western song: “[Ida Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFef08YZ6qk),” Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, a hit in 1951. Apparently, Chess brothers has the same response as Sam Phillips a year earlier: That's that sound, this guy can do this new Rock 'n' Roll sound. But here is where the story takes a slight detour. They said to Chuck:
> We can record the way it is and we think this will be a hit, this sounds really good. But you didn't write this song. Bob Wills and his band wrote this song so if it's a big hit, you will sure get some money, but a lot of money will go to Bob Wills because they wrote the song. So what you need to do is change it. Rewrite the lyrics, change the melody a little bit. Keep the same basic feeling but turn it to something that is original.

So Chuck wrote lyrics about car chase. Finally they got a song, “Maybellene” (1955). It sounded like this.

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

Very quickly *Maybellene* becomes a hit. Chuck finds himself as star in this newly emerging style of Rock 'n' Roll. Chuck did his research: know what his audience wanted, shape his music to his audience's taste. He starts to write songs that address the concerns of extended adolescence. He actually invents some of prime themes that will be part of Rock 'n' Roll music for decades. He brings them all together in a way that will become linked with the Rock 'n' Roll music.

For example, *cars*, cars represent freedom. Second, *romantic relationships*. Most of the songs are written from male perspective, which means in most Rock 'n' Roll, women are not as subjects, but as objects to be pursued, obtained, displayed. And *no school*, freedom on weekend. Finally, *celebration of Rock 'n' Roll*, the music itself being celebrated within Rock 'n' Roll songs. Quite remarkable. Thus Berry deliberately writing for middle class young white audience. Not only the lyrics, but he tailored his sound and guitar voice for his audience. A wonderful example, "Johnny B. Goode" (1958).

<p align="center">&#9834; <i>music playing</i> &#9834;</p>

\#2 R&B / \#8 Pop - 12 Bar Blues with a “text heavy” narrative

White elements (to appeal white audience):
-	text heavy - narrative
-	clear enunciation
-	country guitar sound

Black Elements:
-	Blues chord structure
-	Accompaniment pattern: Added 6<sup>th</sup> (boogie woogie)
-	guitar solo is based on timbre, articulation and rhythm by using different techniques.

> “Listening to Nat Cole prompted me to sing sentimental songs with distinct diction. The songs of Muddy Waters impelled me to deliver the down-home blues in the language they came from. When I played hillbilly songs, I stressed my diction so that it was harder and whiter. All in all, it was my intention to hold both the black and the white clientele by voicing the different kinds of songs in their customary tongues.” (Chuck Berry)

Certainly Elvis was successful, more famous, but Chuck is more influential. Why?
- Elvis didn't write his own songs. Do covers and have professional song writers for him. Whereas Chuck wrote all of his own songs.
- Elvis wasn't a bad guitar player, but guitar was not central to what he did. Whereas you can't take guitar out of Chuck's songs.

Very shortly, we will see next generation of Rock 'n' Roll artists. They respect Elvis, but they are going to base themselves as model on Chuck Berry. A young man once said, if you want to give Rock 'n' Roll another name, you can call it Chuck Berry. That young man was John Lennon, who we will meet a couple of weeks when we talk about The Beatles.

## Part C: The End Of The Golden Age of Rock and Roll
