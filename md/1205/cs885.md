# Introduction

## Machine Learning
- Traditional computer science
    - Program computer for every task
- New paradigm
    - Provide examples to machine
    - Machine learns to accomplish a task based on the examples
        - computer vision: feed computer with lots of images, eventually learn to extract correct patterns. Programmers don't need to think of the rules to achieve right things.
        - NLP: learn to do machine translation. Discover patterns to match right expression.
- Success mostly due to supervised learning
    - Bottleneck: need lots of labeled data
- Alternatives
    - Unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning
    - Reinforcement Learning

## What is RL?
Reinforcement learning is also known as
- Optimal control
- Approximate dynamic programming
- Neuro-dynamic programming

which are from different history or perspective.

From wiki: reinforcement learning is an area of
machine learning inspired by behavioural psychology,
concerned with how software agents ought to take
actions in an environment so as to maximize some
notion of cumulative reward.

It comes from psychology. In animal psychology,
- Negative reinforcements:
    - Pain and hunger
- Positive reinforcements:
    - Pleasure and food
- Reinforcements used to train animals
