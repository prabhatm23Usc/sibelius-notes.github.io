# Lecture 1
Objectives of this course:
- basic concepts of AI
- different methods for function approximation
- select the right learning scheme
- difference between shallow & deep learning
- verify the learning capability
- run and evaluate experiments
- write a scientific paper

Lecture Topics:
1. Encoding/embedding: data compression, PCA, t-SNE, Fisher Vector, ..., <span>&#92;(k &#92;)</span>-fold cross validation, leave-one-out
2. Classification/clustering: K-means, FCM, SVM, self-organizing maps
3. Learning: Perceptron, backpropagation, CNN, AEs
4. Reinforcement learning: check [CS 885](/cs/885)
5. Uncertain vs. vague: Probability, FuzzyLogic, DTs, RFs

*Why interest in AI?*
- Recent progress in algorithms
- Availability of data
- Computational power

## History of AI
1901 - PCA (K. Pearson)

1933 - PCA development (H. Hotelling)

1958 - Perceptron (F. Rosenblatt)

1965 - Fuzzy Sets (L. Zadeh)

1969 - Limitation of Perceptron (Minsky/Papert)

1982 - SOM (T. Kohonen)

1986 - Backpropation ([Rumelhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart)/Hinton)

1986 - ID3 algorithm ([J.R. Quinlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Quinlan))

1993 - C 4.5 algorithm (J.R. Quinlan)

1995 - SVM (Cortes/Vapnik)

1995/2001 - Random Forest (T.K.Ho/L.Breiman)

2006 - Fast learning for deep belief Nets (Hinton et al.)

2007 - Greedy layer-wise training for deep Nets (Bengio et al.)

2012 - AlexNet

## Main Tasks for AI
- Classification
- Estimation/Prediction
- Search
- Optimization
- Inference

All these is approximation: you have a black box <span>&#92;(f(x) &#92;)</span>, some <span>&#92;(x &#92;)</span> goes in and some <span>&#92;(y &#92;)</span> goes out. <span>&#92;(f &#92;)</span> is unknown. The simplest approach is regression.

*What is intelligence?*

"the act of knowing" <span>&#92;(\implies &#92;)</span> intelligence <span>&#92;(\stackrel{?}{=} &#92;)</span> knowledge

"the exercise of understanding" <span>&#92;(\implies &#92;)</span> intelligence = understanding

|actions | act | rational actions (AI) |

*Can we measure intelligence?*
