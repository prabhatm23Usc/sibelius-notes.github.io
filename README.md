# My Lecture Notes
In the future, I will keep it consistent, i.e., LaTeX for math courses and markdown for arts courses. Maybe just for quick scatter cs notes, I will also use markdown.

# Layouts
- `_posts/`: collection of courses
- `markdown/`: old markdown layout from `generate-md`
- `md/`: new markdown layout from bootstrap toc
- `_term/`: group by term
- `_subject/`: group by subject
- `pdfs/`: courses related PDFs
