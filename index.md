  ## Sibelius Peng's Lecture Notes
---
## About

This website contains Lecture Notes only, as well as my thoughts regarding the course.

The courses are categorized in nav bar as follows:
- **All**: All courses
- **Subject**: Grouped by subject
- **Term**: Grouped by term

Also, check my [blogs](https://blog.sibeliusp.com) and check my [home page](https://sibeliusp.com).

## Disclaimer

Most (while some are contributed by my friends) of these notes are written in their entirety by me, Sibelius Peng, while attending lectures at the University of Waterloo. I have no intentions of violating any UW policies and will gladly honour takedown notices produced by an authorized UW representative. They are by no means authoritative so use at your own peril.

## Miscellaneous
**Note**: Starting from Winter 2020 (as well as [AMATH 271](/2019/09/01/AMATH271/) in Fall 2019), the LaTeXed Notes will have two versions: online view (with no blank pages in between) and print (force the first page of a chapter to be on the odd numbered page by inserting blanking pages).

I also made a [courses dependency graph](/courses_dependency/).
