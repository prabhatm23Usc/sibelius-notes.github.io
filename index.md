## About

This website contains Lecture Notes only, as well as my thoughts regarding the course.

Also, check my [blogs](https://blog.sibeliusp.com) and check my [home page](https://sibeliusp.com).

## Disclaimer

Most (while some are contributed by my friends) of these notes are written in their entirety by me, [Sibelius Peng](https://sibeliusp.com), while attending lectures at the University of Waterloo. I have no intentions of violating any UW policies and will gladly honour takedown notices produced by an authorized UW representative. They are by no means authoritative so use at your own peril.
